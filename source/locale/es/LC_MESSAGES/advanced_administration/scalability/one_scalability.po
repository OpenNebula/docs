"OpenNebula supports two native monitoring systems: ``ssh-pull`` and ``udp-"
"push``. The former one, ``ssh-pull`` is the default monitoring system for "
"OpenNebula <= 4.2, however from OpenNebula 4.4 onwards, the default "
"monitoring system is the ``udp-push`` system. This model is highly scalable "
"and its limit (in terms of number of VMs monitored per second) is bounded to"
" the performance of the server running oned and the database server. Our "
"scalability testing achieves the monitoring of tens of thousands of VMs in a"
" few minutes."
