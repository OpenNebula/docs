msgstr ""

#: ../../source/advanced_administration/scalability/suns_advance.rst:42
msgid ""
"When using one on these web servers the use of a ``memcached`` server is "
"necessary. Sunstone needs to store user sessions so it does not ask for "
"user/password for every action. By default Sunstone is configured to use "
"memory sessions, that is, the sessions are stored in the process memory. "
"Thin and webrick web servers do not spawn new processes but new threads an "
"all of them have access to that session pool. When using more than one "
"process to server Sunstone there must be a service that stores this "
"information and can be accessed by all the processes. In this case we will "
"need to install ``memcached``. It comes with most distributions and its "
"default configuration should be ok. We will also need to install ruby "
"libraries to be able to access it. The rubygem library needed is ``memcache-"
"client``. If there is no package for your distribution with this ruby "
"library you can install it using rubygems:"

"Another thing you have to take into account is the user on which the server "
"will run. The installation sets the permissions for ``oneadmin`` user and "
"group and files like the Sunstone configuration and credentials can not be "
"read by other users. Apache usually runs as ``www-data`` user and group so "
"to let the server run as this user the group of these files must be changed,"
