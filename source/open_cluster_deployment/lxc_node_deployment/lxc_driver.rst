LXC Driver
================================================================================

Requirements
============

OpenNebula LXC Driver requires the LXC version >= 3.0.3 to be installed on the host.

Considerations & Limitations
================================================================================

Security
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to ensure the security in a multitenant environment only unprivileged containers are supported by LXC drivers.

The unprivileged containers will be deployed as ``root``. It will use ``600100001-600165537`` sub UID/GID range for mapping users/groups in order to increase security in case a malicious agent is able to scape the container.

Storage Limitations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Datablocks require to be formatted with a file system in order to being able to attach it to a container.

- Only file system images are supported.

.. _lxc_unsupported_actions:

Container Actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are a number of regular features that are not implemented yet:
Some of the actions supported by OpenNebula for VMs are not implemented yet for LXC. The following actions are not currently supported:

- ``migration``
- ``live migration``
- ``live disk resize``
- ``save/restore``
- ``snapshots``
- ``disk-saveas``
- ``disk hot-plugging``
- ``nic hot-plugging``

PCI Passthrough
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PCI Passthrough is not currently supported for LXC containers.

Wild Containers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Importing wilds containers that weren't deployed by OpenNebula is not currently supported.


Configuration
================================================================================

OpenNebula
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The LXC driver is enabled by default in OpenNebula ``/etc/one/oned.conf`` on your Front-end host with reasonable defaults. Read the :ref:`oned Configuration <oned_conf_virtualization_drivers>` to understand these configuration parameters and :ref:`Virtual Machine Drivers Reference <devel-vmm>` to know how to customize and extend the drivers.

Driver
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

LXC driver-specific configuration is available in ``/var/lib/one/remotes/etc/vmm/lxc/lxcrc`` on the OpenNebula Front-end node. The following list contains the supported configuration attributes and a brief description:

+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter                  | Description                                                        |
+============================+====================================================================+
| ``:vnc``                   | Options to customize the VNC access to the                         |
|                            | microVM. ``:width``, ``:height``, ``:timeout``, and                |
|                            | ``:command`` can be set                                            |
+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``:datastore_location``    | Default path for the datastores. This only need to be              |
|                            | change if the corresponding value in oned.conf has                 |
|                            | been modified                                                      |
+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``:default_lxc_config``    | Path to the LXC default configuration file. This file              |
|                            | will be included in the configuration of every LXC                 |
|                            | container                                                          |
+----------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

Storage
================================================================================

LXC containers need a root file system image in order to boot. This images can be downloaded directly to OpenNebula from `Docker Hub <https://hub.docker.com/>`__, `Linux Containers <https://uk.images.linuxcontainers.org/>`__ and `Turnkey Linux <https://www.turnkeylinux.org/>`__ Marketplaces. Check :ref:`Public Marketplaces <public_marketplaces>` chapter for more information.

.. note:: Custom images can also be created by using common linux tools like ``mkfs`` command for creating the file system and ``dd`` for copying and existing file system inside the new one.

Networking
================================================================================

LXC containers are fully integrated with every OpenNebula networking driver.

Usage
================================================================================

Container Template
-----------------------

Container Templates can be defined by using the same attributes described in :ref:`Virtual Machine Template section <vm_templates>`.

.. code::

    CPU="1"
    MEMORY="146"
    CONTEXT=[
      NETWORK="YES",
      SSH_PUBLIC_KEY="$USER[SSH_PUBLIC_KEY]" ]
    DISK=[
      IMAGE="Alpine Linux 3.11",
      IMAGE_UNAME="oneadmin" ]
    GRAPHICS=[
      LISTEN="0.0.0.0",
      TYPE="VNC" ]
    NIC=[
      NETWORK="vnet",
      NETWORK_UNAME="oneadmin",
      SECURITY_GROUPS="0" ]

Remote Access
-----------------------

Containers supports remote access via VNC protocol which allows easy access to them. The following section must be added to the container template to configure the VNC access:

.. code::

    GRAPHICS=[
      LISTEN="0.0.0.0",
      TYPE="VNC" ]

Additional Attributes
-----------------------

The ``RAW`` attribute allows to add raw LXC configuration attributes to the final container deployment file. This allows to set configuration attributes that are not directly supported by OpenNebula.

.. code::

    RAW = [
      TYPE = "lxc",
      DATA = "lxc.signal.reboot = 9" ]

.. note:: Each line of the ``DATA`` attribute must contain only an LXC configuration attribute and its corresponding value. If a provided attribute is already set by OpenNebula, it will be discarded and the original value will take precedence.
