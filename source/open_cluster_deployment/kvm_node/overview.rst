Overview
================================================================================

`KVM <https://www.linux-kvm.org/>`__ (Kernel-based Virtual Machine) is the main virtualization solution for Linux on x86 hardware that contains virtualization extensions (Intel VT or AMD-V) and on ARM64 (currently in beta mode). It consists of the loadable KVM kernel modules (one that provides the core virtualization infrastructure and several processor-specific modules), but the complete KVM virtualization stack usually also contains the user-space machine hardware emulator `QEMU <https://www.qemu.org>`__ accelerated by the KVM and virtual machines management tool `libvirt <https://libvirt.org>`__.

By using KVM, you can run multiple Virtual Machines with unmodified Linux or Windows images. Each Virtual Machine has private virtualized hardware - network card, disk, graphics adapter, etc.

How Should I Read This Chapter
================================================================================

This chapter focuses on the configuration options for KVM-based Nodes. Read the :ref:`installation <kvm_node>` section to add a KVM Node to your OpenNebula cloud to start deploying VMs. Continue with the :ref:`driver <kvmg>` section to understand the specific requirements, functionalities, and limitations of the KVM driver.

You can then move on to the Open Cloud :ref:`Storage <storage>` and :ref:`Networking <nm>` chapters to be able to deploy Virtual Machines on your KVM nodes and access them remotely over the network.

Hypervisor Compatibility
================================================================================

This chapter applies only to KVM.
