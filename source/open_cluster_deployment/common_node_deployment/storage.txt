You can skip this step entirely if you just want to try out OpenNebula, as it will come configured by default in such a way that it uses the local storage of the Front-end to store Images, and the local storage of the hypervisors as storage for the running VMs.

However, if you want to set-up another storage configuration at this stage, like Ceph, NFS, LVM, etc, you should read the :ref:`Open Cloud Storage <storage>` chapter.
