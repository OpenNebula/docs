.. warning::

    If you are performing an upgrade skip this and the next steps and go back to the upgrade document.

Depending on the type of OpenNebula deployment, the SELinux can block some operations initiated by the OpenNebula Front-end, which results in a failure of the particular operation.  It's **not recommended to disable** the SELinux on production environments, as it degrades the security of your server, but to investigate and workaround each individual problem based on the `SELinux User's and Administrator's Guide <https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/7/html/selinux_users_and_administrators_guide/>`__. The administrator might disable the SELinux to temporarily workaround the problem or on non-production deployments by changing following line in ``/etc/selinux/config``:

.. code-block:: bash

    SELINUX=disabled

After the change, you have to reboot the machine.

.. note:: Depending on your OpenNebula deployment type, the following may be required on your SELinux-enabled nodes:

    * package ``util-linux`` newer than 2.23.2-51 installed
    * SELinux boolean ``virt_use_nfs`` enabled (with datastores on NFS):

    .. prompt:: bash # auto

        # setsebool -P virt_use_nfs on
