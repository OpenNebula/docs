LDAP Authentication
====================

The LDAP Authentication addon permits users to have the same credentials as in LDAP, so effectively centralizing authentication. Enabling it will let any correctly authenticated LDAP user to use OpenNebula.

Prerequisites
=============

.. warning:: This Addon requires the **'net/ldap'** ruby library provided by the 'net-ldap' gem.

This Addon will not install any Ldap server or configure it in any way. It will not create, delete or modify any entry in the Ldap server it connects to. The only requirement is the ability to connect to an already running Ldap server and being able to perform a successful **ldapbind** operation and have a user able to perform searches of users, therefore no special attributes or values are required in the LDIF entry of the user authenticating.

Configuration
=============

Configuration file for auth module is located at ``/etc/one/auth/ldap_auth.conf``. This is the default configuration:

.. code::

    server 1:
        # Ldap user able to query, if not set connects as anonymous. For
        # Active Directory append the domain name. Example:
        # Administrator@my.domain.com
        #:user: 'admin'
        #:password: 'password'
     
        # Ldap authentication method
        :auth_method: :simple
     
        # Ldap server
        :host: localhost
        :port: 389
     
        # base hierarchy where to search for users and groups
        :base: 'dc=domain'
     
        # group the users need to belong to. If not set any user will do
        #:group: 'cn=cloud,ou=groups,dc=domain'
     
        # field that holds the user name, if not set 'cn' will be used
        :user_field: 'cn'
     
        # for Active Directory use this user_field instead
        #:user_field: 'sAMAccountName'
     
    # this example server wont be called as it is not in the :order list
    server 2:
        :auth_method: :simple
        :host: localhost
        :port: 389
        :base: 'dc=domain'
        #:group: 'cn=cloud,ou=groups,dc=domain'
        :user_field: 'cn'
     
     
    # List the order the servers are queried
    :order:
        - server 1
        #- server 2

The structure is a hash where any key different to ``:order`` will contain the configuration of one ldap server we want to query. The special key ``:order`` holds an array with the order we want to query the configured servers. Any server not listed in ``:order`` wont be queried.

To enable ``ldap`` authentication the described parameters should be configured. OpenNebula must be also configured to enable external authentication. Uncomment these lines in ``/etc/one/oned.conf`` and add ``ldap`` and ``default`` (more on this later) as an enabled authentication method.

.. code::

    AUTH_MAD = [
        executable = "one_auth_mad",
        authn = "default,ssh,x509,ldap,server_cipher,server_x509"
    ]

To be able to use this driver for users that are still not in the user database you must set it to the ``default`` driver. To do this go to the auth drivers directory and copy the directory ``ldap`` to ``default``. In system-wide installations you can do this using this command:

.. code::

    $ cp -R /var/lib/one/remotes/auth/ldap /var/lib/one/remotes/auth/default

User Management
===============

Using LDAP authentication module the administrator doesn't need to create users with ``oneuser`` command as this will be automatically done. The user should add its credentials to ``$ONE_AUTH`` file (usually ``$HOME/.one/one_auth``) in this fashion:

.. code::

    <user_dn>:ldap_password

where

-  ``<user_dn>`` the DN of the user in the LDAP service
-  ``ldap_password`` is the password of the user in the LDAP service

.. _ldap_dn_with_special_characters:

DN's With Special Characters
----------------------------

When the user dn or password contains blank spaces the LDAP driver will escape them so they can be used to create OpenNebula users. Therefore, users needs to set up their ``$ONE_AUTH`` file accordingly.

Users can easily create escaped $ONE\_AUTH tokens with the command ``oneuser encode <user> [<password>]``, as an example:

.. code::

    $ oneuser encode 'cn=First Name,dc=institution,dc=country' 'pass word'
    cn=First%20Name,dc=institution,dc=country:pass%20word

The output of this command should be put in the ``$ONE_AUTH`` file.

Active Directory
================

LDAP Auth drivers are able to connect to Active Directory. You will need:

-  Active Directory server with support for simple user/password authentication.
-  User with read permissions in the Active Directory user's tree.

You will need to change the following values in the configuration file (``/etc/one/auth/ldap_auth.conf``):

-  ``:user``: the Active Directory user with read permissions in the user's tree plus the domain. For example for user **Administrator** at domain **win.opennebula.org** you specify it as ``Administrator@win.opennebula.org``
-  ``:password``: password of this user
-  ``:host``: hostname or IP of the Domain Controller
-  ``:base``: base DN to search for users. You need to decompose the full domain name and use each part as DN component. Example, for ``win.opennebula.org`` you will get te base DN: DN=win,DN=opennebula,DN=org
-  ``:user_field``: set it to ``sAMAccountName``

``:group`` parameter is still not supported for Active Directory, leave it commented.

Enabling LDAP auth in Sunstone
==============================

Update the ``/etc/one/sunstone-server.conf`` :auth parameter to use the ``opennebula``:

.. code::

        :auth: opennebula

Using this method the credentials provided in the login screen will be sent to the OpenNebula core and the authentication will be delegated to the OpenNebula auth system, using the specified driver for that user. Therefore any OpenNebula auth driver can be used through this method to authenticate the user (i.e: LDAP).

To automatically encode credentials as explained in :ref:`DN's with special characters <ldap_dn_with_special_characters>` section also add this parameter to sunstone configuration:

.. code::

        :encode_user_password: true
