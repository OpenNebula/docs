Scheduler Configuration
=======================

The OpenNebula Scheduler is responsible for **planning of the pending Virtual Machines on available hypervisor Nodes**. It's a dedicated daemon installed alongside the OpenNebula Daemon (``oned``), but can be deployed independently on a different machine. The Scheduler is distributed as an operating system package ``opennebula`` with the system service ``opennebula-scheduler``.

.. _schg_the_match_making_scheduler:

Scheduling Algorithm
====================

OpenNebula comes with a **match-making** scheduler (``/usr/bin/mm_sched``) that implements the **Rank Scheduling Policy**. The goal of this policy is to prioritize those resources more suitable for the VM.

The match-making algorithm works as follows:

* Each disk of a running VM consumes storage from an Image Datastore. The VMs that require more storage than it is currently available are filtered out and will remain in the ``pending`` state.
* The hosts that do not meet the VM requirements (see the :ref:`SCHED_REQUIREMENTS attribute <template_placement_section>`) or do not have enough resources (available CPU and memory) to run the VM are filtered out (see below for more information).
* The same happens for System Datastores: the ones that do not meet the DS requirements (see the :ref:`SCHED_DS_REQUIREMENTS attribute <template>`) or do not have enough free storage are filtered out.
* Finally, if the VM uses automatic network selection, the Virtual Networks that do not meet the NIC requirements (see the :ref:`SCHED_REQUIREMENTS attribute for NICs <template>`) or do not have enough free leases are filtered out.
* The :ref:`SCHED_RANK and SCHED_DS_RANK expressions <template_placement_section>` are evaluated upon the Host and Datastore list using the information gathered by the monitor drivers. Also, the :ref:`NIC/SCHED_RANK expressions <template_network_section>` are evaluated upon the Network list using the information in the Virtual Network template. Any variable reported by the monitor driver (or manually set in the Host, Datastore, or Network template) can be included in the rank expressions.
* The resources with a higher rank are used first to allocate VMs.

The Scheduling algorithm easily allows us to implement several placement heuristics (see below) depending on the selected ``RANK`` expressions.

The policy used to place a VM can be configured in two places:

* Globally, for all the VMs in the configuration file ``/etc/one/sched.conf`` of the scheduler.
* For each VM, as defined by the general ``SCHED_RANK`` and ``SCHED_DS_RANK`` and NIC-specific ``SCHED_RANK`` in the VM template.

.. _schg_configuration:

Configuration
=============

The Scheduler configuration file is ``/etc/one/sched.conf`` on the Front-end, and can be customized with the parameters listed in the table below.

.. note::

    After a configuration change, the OpenNebula Scheduler must be :ref:`restarted <sched_conf_service>` to take effect.

.. tip::

    For a quick view of any changes in configuration file options in maintenance releases, check the Resolved Issues page in the :ref:`Release Notes <rn_enterprise>` for the release. Please note that even in the case of changes (such as a new option available), you do *not* need to update your configuration files unless you wish to change the application's behavior.

* ``MESSAGE_SIZE``: Buffer size in bytes for XML-RPC responses (Default: ``1073741824``).
* ``TIMEOUT``: Seconds to timeout XML-RPC calls to oned (Default: ``60``).
* ``ONE_XMLRPC``: Endpoint of the OpenNebula XML-RPC API (Default: ``http://localhost:2633/RPC2``)
* ``HTTP_PROXY``: Proxy for ``ONE_XMLRPC`` (Default empty)
* ``SCHED_INTERVAL``: Seconds between two scheduling actions (Default: ``15``)
* ``MAX_VM``: Maximum number of VMs scheduled in each scheduling action (Default: ``5000``). Use ``0`` to schedule all pending VMs each time.
* ``MAX_DISPATCH``: Maximum number of Virtual Machines actually dispatched to a host in each scheduling action (Default: 30)
* ``MAX_HOST``: Maximum number of Virtual Machines dispatched to a given host in each scheduling action (Default: 1)
* ``LIVE_RESCHEDS``: Rescheduling VMs performs migrations as ``1`` - live, ``0`` - cold.
* ``COLD_MIGRATE_MODE``: Defines mode of cold VM migration. Options ``0`` - save, ``1`` - poweroff, ``2`` - poweroff hard. Please, note that parameter is taken into account for actions initiated by the scheduler but not users (e.g. migration commands instantiated by user from Sunstone or command line interface will ignore that parameter). See :ref:`one.vm.migrate <one_vm_migrate>`.
* ``MEMORY_SYSTEM_DS_SCALE``: This factor scales the VM usage of the system DS with the memory size. This factor can be use to make the scheduler consider the overhead of checkpoint files (*system_ds_usage = system_ds_usage + memory_system_ds_scale * memory*).
* ``DIFFERENT_VNETS``: When set (``YES``) the NICs of a VM will be forced to be in different Virtual Networks.

The default scheduling policies for hosts, datastores and virtual networks are defined as follows:

* ``DEFAULT_SCHED``: Definition of the default scheduling algorithm.

   * ``RANK``: Arithmetic expression to rank suitable **hosts** based on their attributes.
   * ``POLICY``: A predefined policy, it can be set to:

* ``EXTERNAL_SCHEDULER``: Configuration to contact an external scheduler module:

   * ``SERVER``, the http URL to perform the POST operation
   * ``PROXY``, if needed to contact the external scheduler
   * ``TIMEOUT``, how long to wait for a response

* ``VM_ATTRIBUTE``: Attributes serialized to External Scheduler, the format is 'XPATH<:NAME>' where:

    * XPATH, is the xpath of the attribute
    * NAME, (optional) is the name of the attribute used in the JSON doc sent to the external scheduler, if not set the original name will be used.
    * Examples:

        - ``VM_ATTRIBUTE = "/VM/TEMPLATE/CPU"``
        - ``VM_ATTRIBUTE = "//CPU"``
        - ``VM_ATTRIBUTE = "/VM/TEMPLATE/VMGROUP/ROLE:GROUP_ROLE"``

* ``LOG``: Configuration for the logging system.

  * ``SYSTEM``: Defines logging system. Use ``file`` to log in the ``sched.log`` file, ``syslog`` to use syslog, ``std`` to use default log stream (stderr).
  * ``DEBUG_LEVEL``: Logging level. Use ``0`` for ERROR, ``1`` for WARNING, ``2`` for INFO, ``3`` for DEBUG, ``4`` for DDEBUG, ``5`` for DDDEBUG.

The optimal values of the scheduler parameters depend on the hypervisor, storage subsystem, and a number of physical hosts. The values can be derived by finding out the max. number of VMs that can be started in your setup without getting hypervisor-related errors.

.. _sched_conf_service:

Service Control and Logs
========================

Change the server running state by managing the operating system service ``opennebula-scheduler``.

To start, restart or stop the server, execute one of:

.. prompt:: bash # auto

    # systemctl start   opennebula-scheduler
    # systemctl restart opennebula-scheduler
    # systemctl stop    opennebula-scheduler

.. note::

   The service is automatically started (unless masked) upon the start of the OpenNebula Daemon.

Server **logs** are located in ``/var/log/one`` in following file:

- ``/var/log/one/sched.log``

Other logs are also available in Journald; use the following command to show:

.. prompt:: bash # auto

    # journalctl -u opennebula-scheduler.service

Advanced Usage
==============

VM Policies
-----------
VMs are dispatched to hosts in a FIFO fashion. You can alter this behavior by giving each VM (or the base template) a priority. Just set the attribute ``USER_PRIORITY`` to sort the VMs based on this attribute and so alter the dispatch order. The ``USER_PRIORITY`` can be set for example in the VM templates for a user group if you want to prioritize those templates. Note that this priority is also used for rescheduling.

.. _schg_re-scheduling_virtual_machines:

Reschedule VM
-------------

When a Virtual Machine is in the ``running`` or ``poweroff`` state, it can be rescheduled to a different host. By issuing the ``onevm resched`` command, the VM is labeled for rescheduling. In the next scheduling interval, the VM will be rescheduled to a different host, if:

* There is a suitable host for the VM.
* The VM is not already running in it.

This feature can be used by other components to trigger rescheduling action when certain conditions are met.

Scheduling VM Actions
---------------------

Users can schedule one or more VM actions to be executed at a certain date and time. The :ref:`onevm schedule <cli>` command will add a new ``SCHED_ACTION`` attribute to the Virtual Machine editable template. Visit the :ref:`VM guide <vm_guide2_scheduling_actions>` for more information.

.. _schg_limit:

Limit/Overprovision Host Capacity
---------------------------------

Prior to assigning a VM to a Host, the available capacity is checked to ensure that the VM fits in the Host. The capacity is obtained by the monitor probes. You may alter this behavior by reserving an amount of capacity (``MEMORY`` and ``CPU``). You can reserve this capacity:

* **Cluster-wise**, by updating the cluster template (e.g. ``onecluster update``). All the hosts of the cluster will reserve the same amount of capacity.
* **Host-wise**, by updating the host template (e.g. ``onehost update``). This value will override those defined at the cluster level.

Following capacity attributes can be set:

* ``RESERVED_CPU`` in percentage. It will be subtracted from the ``TOTAL CPU``.
* ``RESERVED_MEM`` in KB. It will be subtracted from the ``TOTAL MEM``.

.. note::

    These values can be **negative to virtually increase the overall capacity** (to overcommit/overprovision CPU or memory).
