WHMCS Tenants Module User Guide
===============================

Register an Account
-------------------

To register a new account, navigate to the client area of your WHMCS install and then go to **Account** -> **Register**.  Fill out the following form and proceed with user creation. After it's completed you should be able to log in as that new user.

Order a New Service
-------------------

To view the available products navigate to **Services** -> **Order New Services**. This page will display all available services which can be purchased.  One can be added to the cart by clicking the corresponding **Order Now** button. After checking out, the new order will be created.

Upgrade a Service
-----------------

To upgrade a product, navigate to the product's page.  On the left side there should be a button to **Upgrade Product**, which should show you a list of available packages to upgrade to. Simply add to the cart and check out much like when ordering a new service, and a new order will be created to upgrade your product.

Managing Services
-----------------

As a user, when viewing a Product/Service there should be an action **Login** which should redirect them to the OpenNebula interface where they should be able to manage their Virtual Machines within the limits that the Product allows.
