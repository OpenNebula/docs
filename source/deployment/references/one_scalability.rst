Scalability Testing and Tuning
=============================================

Determining the scalability of your cloud, and how to improve it, requires balancing many variables. There are several aspects that can limit the scalability of a cloud, from the storage to the network backend, and no one solution meets everyoneâ€™s scalability goals. This guide firstly presents the scale limits of a single OpenNebula instance (single zone), and then provides some recommendations to tune your deployment for large scale.

The general recommendation is to have no more than 2,500 servers and 10,000 VMs managed by a single instance. Better performance and higher scalability can be achieved with specific tuning of other components like the DB, or better hardware. In any case, to grow the size of your cloud beyond these limits, you can horizontally scale your cloud by adding new OpenNebula zones within a :ref:`federated deployment <introf>`. The largest OpenNebula deployment consists of 16 data centers and 300,000 cores.

Scalability Testing
==========================================

Front-end (oned) Scalability
-------------------------------------------

This section focuses on the scale limits of oned, the controller component, for a single OpenNebula zone. The limits recommended here are associated with a given API load; you may consider reducing or increasing the limits based on your actual API requests. Notice that the maximum number of servers (virtualization hosts) that can be managed by a single OpenNebula instance strongly depends on the performance and scalability of the underlying platform infrastructure, mainly the storage subsystem.
The following results have been obtained with synthetic workloads that stress oned running on a physical server with the following specifications:

+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| CPU model:           | Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU C2550 @ 2.40GHz, 4 cores, no HT   |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| RAM:                 | 8GB, DDR3, 1600 MT/s, single channel                    |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| HDD:                 | INTEL SSDSC2BB150G7                                     |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| OS:                  | Ubuntu 18.04                                            |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| OpenNebula:          | Version 5.8                                             |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+
| Database:            | MariaDB v10.1 with default configurations               |
+----------------------+---------------------------------------------------------+

In a single zone, OpenNebula (oned) can work with the following limits:

+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Number of hosts          | 2,500                                               |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Number of VMs            | 10,000                                              |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+
| Average VM template size | 7 KB                                                |
+--------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------+

In production environments, we do not recommend exceeding in the same installation this number of servers (2,500) and VMs (10,000), as well as a load of 30 API requests/s to avoid excessive slowness of the system. Better performance can be achieved with specific tuning of other components, like the database, or better hardware.

The four most common API calls were used to stress the core at the same time in approximately the same ratio experienced on real deployments. The total numbers of API calls per second used were: 10, 20 and 30. In these conditions, with a host monitoring interval of 20 hosts/second, in a pool with 2,500 hosts and a monitoring period on each host of 125 seconds, the response times in seconds of the oned process for the most common XMLRPC calls are shown below:


+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                               Response Time (seconds)                                 |
+-----------------------+---------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| API Call - ratio      | API Load: 10 req/s  | API Load: 20 req/s | API Load: 30 req/s |
+-----------------------+---------------------+--------------------+--------------------+
| host.info (30%)       | 0.06                | 0.50               | 0.54               |

+-----------------------+---------------------+--------------------+--------------------+

Hypervisor Scalability
--------------------------------------

The number of VMs (or containers) a virtualization node can run is limited by the monitoring probes. In this section we have evaluated the performance of the monitoring probes for the KVM and LXD drivers. The host specs are the following:

+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| CPU model:    | Intel(R) Atom(TM) CPU C2550 @ 2.40GHz, 4 cores, no HT  |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| RAM:          | 8GB, DDR3, 1600 MT/s, single channel                   |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| HDD:          | INTEL SSDSC2BB150G7                                    |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| OS:           | Ubuntu 18.04                                           |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+
| Hypervisor:   | Libvirt (4.0), Qemu (2.11), lxd (3.03)                 |
+---------------+--------------------------------------------------------+

Containers and VMs settings used for monitoring tests:

+-------------+-------------------+-------+------------+--------------+
| Hypervisor  | OS                | RAM   | CPU        | Max. VM/host |
+-------------+-------------------+-------+------------+--------------+
| KVM         | None (empty disk) | 32MB  | 0.1        | 250          |
+-------------+-------------------+-------+------------+--------------+
| LXD         | Alpine            | 32MB  | 0.1        | 250          |
+-------------+-------------------+-------+------------+--------------+

Note: 250 instances were deployed for both types of hypervisor because both templates were created with the same capacity requirements. This made allocated resources grow at the same rate, so the scheduler instantiated the same number of KVM VMs as LXD containers. It is worth noticing that the overhead on KVM VMs is bigger than on LXD containers, so the latter hypervisor technology allows for bigger density when compared to KVM, as shown in `this report <https://blog.ubuntu.com/2015/05/18/lxd-crushes-kvm-in-density-and-speed>`_.

Monitoring times for each type of instance are shown below:

+-------------+----------------------------------------+
| Hypervisor  | Monitoring time (seconds) per instance |
+-------------+----------------------------------------+
| KVM         | 0.42                                   |
+-------------+----------------------------------------+
| LXD         | 0.1                                    |
+-------------+----------------------------------------+


Note that there may be other factors that limit the number of VMs or containers running in a single host.

Tuning for Large Scale
==================================

Monitoring Tuning
-----------------------------------

In KVM environments, OpenNebula supports two native monitoring systems: ``ssh-pull`` and ``udp-push``. The former one, ``ssh-pull`` is the default monitoring system for OpenNebula <= 4.2, however from OpenNebula 4.4 onwards, the default monitoring system is ``udp-push``. This model is highly scalable, and its limit (in terms of number of VMs monitored per second) is bound by the performance of the server running oned and the database server. Read more in the :ref:`Monitoring guide <mon>`.

For vCenter environments, OpenNebula uses the VI API offered by vCenter to monitor the state of the hypervisor and all the Virtual Machines running in all the imported vCenter clusters. The driver is optimized to cache common VM information.

In both environments, our scalability testing achieves monitoring of tens of thousands of VMs in a few minutes.

Core Tuning
---------------------------

OpenNebula keeps the monitoring history for a defined time in a database table. These values are then used to draw the plots in Sunstone. These monitoring entries can take quite a bit of storage in your database. The amount of storage used will depend on the size of your cloud, and the following configuration attributes in :ref:`oned.conf <oned_conf>`:

-  ``MONITORING_INTERVAL_HOST``: Time in seconds between each monitoring cycle. Default: 180. This parameter sets the timeout to pro-actively restart the monitoring probe in the standard ``udp-push`` model.
-  collectd IM\_MAD ``-i`` argument (KVM only): Time in seconds of the monitoring push cycle. Default: 60.
-  ``HOST_MONITORING_EXPIRATION_TIME``: Time, in seconds, to expire monitoring information. Default: 12h.
-  ``VM_MONITORING_EXPIRATION_TIME``: Time, in seconds, to expire monitoring information. Default: 4h.
-  ``MONITORING_INTERVAL_DB_UPDATE``: Time in seconds between DB writes of VM monitoring information. Default: 0 (write every update).


.. important:: It is highly recommended to increase the ``MONITORING_INTERVAL_DB_UPDATE`` and the ``IM_MAD-collectd`` ``-i`` argument when running more than 5K VMs, so as not to overload DB write threads. Usually a slow response time from the API when running a high number of VMs is caused by this.

If you donâ€™t use Sunstone, you may want to disable the monitoring history, setting both expiration times to 0.

Each monitoring entry will be around 2 KB for each Host, and 4 KB for each VM. To give you an idea of how much database storage you will need to prepare, here are some examples:

+-----------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| Monitoring interval   | Host expiration   | # Hosts   | Storage   |
+=======================+===================+===========+===========+
| 20s                   | 12h               | 200       | 850 MB    |
+-----------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+
| 20s                   | 24h               | 1,000      | 8.2 GB   |
+-----------------------+-------------------+-----------+-----------+

+-----------------------+-----------------+---------+-----------+
| Monitoring interval   | VM expiration   | # VMs   | Storage   |
+=======================+=================+=========+===========+
| 20s                   | 4h              | 2,000    | 1.8 GB   |
+-----------------------+-----------------+---------+-----------+
| 20s                   | 24h             | 10,000   | 7 GB     |
+-----------------------+-----------------+---------+-----------+

API Tuning
-------------------------

For large deployments with lots of XML-RPC calls, the default values for the XML-RPC server are too conservative. The values you can modify, and their meaning, are explained in :ref:`oned.conf <oned_conf>` and the `xmlrpc-c library documentation <http://xmlrpc-c.sourceforge.net/doc/libxmlrpc_server_abyss.html#max_conn>`__. From our experience, these values improve the server behavior with a large number of client calls:

 .. code-block:: none
 
     MAX_CONN = 240
     MAX_CONN_BACKLOG = 480

The core is able to paginate some pool answers. This makes the memory consumption decrease, and in some cases makes the parsing faster. By default the pagination value is 2,000 objects, but it can be changed using the environment variable ``ONE_POOL_PAGE_SIZE``. It should be bigger than 2. For example, to list VMs with a page size of 5,000 we can use:

 .. prompt:: text $ auto
 
     $ ONE_POOL_PAGE_SIZE=5000 onevm list
 
To disable pagination we can use a non numeric value:
 
 .. prompt:: text $ auto
 
     $ ONE_POOL_PAGE_SIZE=disabled onevm list

This environment variable can be also used for Sunstone.
Also, one of the main barriers to scaling OpenNebula is the list operation on large pools. Since OpenNebula 5.8, the VM pool is listed in a *summarized* form. However we recommend making use of the search operation to reduce the pool size returned by oned. The search operation is available for the VM pool since version 5.8.

Scaling the API SERVER
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to scale OpenNebula, it is recommended to balance client requests across multiple oned processes. This can be achieved by either using existing RAFT followers or adding oneds in an API server-only mode.

When oned is started in read-only (or cache) mode, it resolves any read-only operation by accessing the database directly. In particular, the following API calls are served directly by the server in cache mode:


    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.vmpool.info         | one.clusterpool.info    |  one.group.info         |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.vmpool.accounting   | one.zonepool.info       |  one.user.info          |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.vmpool.showback     | one.secgrouppool.info   |  one.datastore.info     |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.vmpool.monitoring   | one.vdcpool.info        |  one.cluster.info       |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.templatepool.info   | one.vrouterpool.info    |  one.document.info      |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.vnpool.info         | one.marketpool.info     |  one.zone.info          |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.vntemplatepool.info | one.marketapppool.info  |  one.secgroup.info      |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.imagepool.info      | one.vmgrouppool.info    |  one.vdc.info           |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.hostpool.info       | one.template.info       |  one.vrouter.info       |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.hostpool.monitoring | one.vn.info             |  one.market.info        |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.groupool.info       | one.vntemplate.info     |  one.marketapp.info     |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.userpool.info       | one.image.info          |  one.vmgroup.info       |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+
    | one.datastorepool.info  | one.host.info           |  one.zone.raftstatus    |
    +-------------------------+-------------------------+-------------------------+

.. note:: read-only operations enforce any ACL restriction or ownership checks.

Any other API call is forwarded to the active oned process. In this case, the cache server is acting as a simple proxy. The architecture recommended to be used with the cache server is depicted in the following figure:

|scala|

When the Master oned is actually a RAFT cluster, you can simply point the API servers to the VIP address of the cluster. Note also that the MySQL server in each RAFT server should be configured to listen on the VIP address to let the API servers query the database.

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To configure an API server you need to:

    1. Install the OpenNebula packages in the server
    2. Update the ``oned.conf`` file so it points to the master oned and Database:

.. code-block:: text

    DB = [ BACKEND = "mysql",
	    SERVER  = "set IP of mysql server",
	    PORT = 0,
	    USER = "oneadmin",
	    PASSWD = "oneadmin",
	    DB_NAME = "opennebula",
	    CONNECTIONS = 50

    FEDERATION = [
	    MODE          = "CACHE",
	    ZONE_ID       = 0,
	    SERVER_ID     = -1,
	    MASTER_ONED   = "set the XML-RPC endpoint of master oned"

Note also that you may need to tune the number of connections to the DB, increasing it for the MySQL server and adjusting the number of cache servers, considering that the overall number of connections is shared by all the servers.

Load Balancing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Alternatively, you may want to set up a load balancer that balances client requests across API servers. HAProxy is a good fit for this task. In this scenario, we are assuming 1 OpenNebula server plus two OpenNebula cache servers. The load balancer is listening on another server on port 2633, and will forward connections to the three OpenNebula servers comprising the cluster. This is the relevant fragment of the required HAProxy configuration for a scenario like the one described:

.. code-block:: text

    frontend OpenNebula
    bind 0.0.0.0:2633
    stats enable
    mode tcp
    default_backend one_nodes

    backend one_nodes
    mode tcp
    stats enable
    balance roundrobin
    server opennebula1 10.134.236.10:2633 check
    server opennebula2 10.134.236.11:2633 check
    server opennebula3 10.134.236.12:2633 check

Server entries must be modified, and the stats section is optional.

Optionally, a second load balancer can be added on another server, and an active-passive redundancy protocol, like VRRP, can be set between both load balancer nodes for high availability.

To connect to the cluster from another server you can use one of the two following options, or both:

- Using the CLI: Create a ``ONE_XMLRPC`` variable with the new endpoint. E.g.

``export ONE_XMLRPC=http://ENDPOINT_IP:2633/RPC2``

- Using Sunstone: Modify ``one_xmlrpc`` in ``/etc/one/sunstone-server.conf``

The new endpoint will be the load balancer address.

Driver Tuning
------------------------

OpenNebula drivers have by default 15 threads. This is the maximum number of actions a driver can perform at the same time; following actions will be queued. You can make this value in :ref:`oned.conf <oned_conf>`. The driver parameter is ``-t``.

Database Tuning
-------------------------

For non-test installations use a MySQL database. SQLite is too slow for more than a couple of hosts and a few VMs.

Be sure to review the :ref:`recommended maintenance procedures <mysql_maintenance>` for the MySQL database backend.

Sunstone Tuning
---------------------------

Please refer to the guide about :ref:`Configuring Sunstone for Large Deployments <suns_advance>`.
