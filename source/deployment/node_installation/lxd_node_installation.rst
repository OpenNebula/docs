LXD Node Installation
=====================

The majority of the steps needed to install the LXD node are similar to KVM because both rely on a Linux OS. Similar steps will have a link in the name and will be indicated by **"Same as KVM"**.

Step 1. Add OpenNebula Repositories
========================================================

:ref:`Same as KVM <kvm_repo>`

Step 2. Installing the Software
===============================

LXD node is only supported on Ubuntu **16.04, 18.04, 18.10**.

.. warning::

    Only **LXD 3.0.x** releases are supported, LXD 2.x and older are not compatible.

Installing on Ubuntu
--------------------

It's recommended to use LXD shipped as a distribution package (via APT) on Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 whenever possible as `snap may be broken for oneadmin when using the LXC CLI <https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/snapd/+bug/1758449>`_, and snap based installations are automatically refreshed whenever there is an update available on the channel. Since Ubuntu 18.10, LXD is shipped only as a snap and managed by distribution transitional package.

.. note::

    **Since OpenNebula 5.8.2**. New meta-package **opennebula-lxd-snap** is provided for Ubuntu 16.04 and 18.04 to manage the LXD snap installation. User can choose between LXD shipped as distribution package **lxd** or LXD snap installed with **opennebula-lxd-snap** by manually installing the preferred one in advance. On Ubuntu 18.10, the LXD snap installation is done directly by **opennebula-node-lxd**. Please note we don't overwrite any already installed LXD snap.

.. warning::

    LXD versions packaged in Ubuntu:

    * Ubuntu 16.04 - **incompatible LXD 2.0**, in xenial-backports LXD 3.0
    * Ubuntu 18.04 - LXD 3.0
    * Ubuntu 18.10 - lxd is a transitional package to install LXD snap (3.0/stable channel)

    On **Ubuntu 16.04** you have to enable **xenial-backports** with regular priority to have access to the supported package with LXD 3.0!


**Ubuntu 16.04**

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ sudo apt-get install opennebula-node-lxd

or, use LXD installed as snap (**since OpenNebula 5.8.2**):

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ sudo apt-get install opennebula-lxd-snap opennebula-node-lxd

**Ubuntu 18.04**

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ sudo apt-get install opennebula-node-lxd

or, use LXD installed as snap (**since OpenNebula 5.8.2**):

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ sudo apt-get install opennebula-lxd-snap opennebula-node-lxd

**Ubuntu 18.10**

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ sudo apt-get install opennebula-node-lxd

**Optionals for all**

To be able to use the Ceph storage drivers, you might need to install additional package with command:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ sudo apt-get install rbd-nbd

For further configuration check the specific guide: :ref:`LXD <lxdmg>`.


Step 4. Configure Passwordless SSH
=====================================================

:ref:`Same as KVM <kvm_ssh>`

Step 5.  Networking Configuration
=======================================================

:ref:`Same as KVM <kvm_net>`

Step 6.  Storage Configuration
=======================================================

:ref:`Same as KVM <kvm_storage>`

Step 7. Adding a Host to OpenNebula
============================================================

:ref:`Same as KVM <kvm_addhost>`

Replace ``kvm`` for ``lxd`` in the CLI and Sunstone

Step 8. Import Existing Containers (Optional)
=========================================================================
You can use the :ref:`import VM <import_wild_vms>` functionality if you want to manage pre-exsiting containers. It is required that containers aren't named under the pattern ``one-<id>`` in order to be imported. They need also to have ``limits.cpu.allowance`` ``limits.cpu`` and ``limits.memory`` keys defined, otherwise OpenNebula cannot import them. The `opennebula-node-lxd` package should setup the default template with these values.
