Firecracker Node Installation
==========================================

The majority of the steps needed to install the Firecracker node are similar to KVM because both rely on a Linux OS and the same hypervisor. Similar steps will have a link in the name and will be indicated by **"Same as KVM"**.

Step 1. Add OpenNebula Repositories
========================================================

:ref:`Same as KVM <kvm_repo>`

Step 2. Installing the Software

Installing on Debian/Ubuntu
---------------------------
