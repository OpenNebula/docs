Repository EPEL
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

OpenNebula depends on packages which are not in the base repositories.
The following repositories have to be enabled before installation:

* only RHEL 7: **optional** and **extras** RHEL repositories
* `EPEL <https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL>`__ (Extra Packages for Enterprise Linux)

On **CentOS**, enabling EPEL is as easy as installation of the package with additional repository configuration:

.. prompt:: bash # auto

    # yum install epel-release

On **RHEL 7**, you enable EPEL by running:

.. note:: RHEL 7 **optional** and **extras** repositories must be configured first.

.. prompt:: bash # auto

    # subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-optional-rpms
    # subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-7-server-extras-rpms
    # rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-7.noarch.rpm

On **RHEL 8**, you enable EPEL by running:

.. prompt:: bash # auto

    # rpm -ivh https://dl.fedoraproject.org/pub/epel/epel-release-latest-8.noarch.rpm
