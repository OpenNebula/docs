OpenNebula Upgrade Workflow
===========================

This section describes the typical OpenNebula upgrade process incorporating the Onecfg.

.. important::

    **For each OpenNebula upgrade (even between minor versions, e.g. 5.10.2 and 5.10.3), configuration files must be processed via 'onecfg upgrade'!** If you skip configuration upgrade step for some OpenNebula upgrade, the tool will lose the current version state and you'll have to handle files upgrade manually and :ref:`reinitialize <cfg_init>` the configuration version management state.

    .. prompt:: bash # auto

        # onecfg upgrade
        FATAL : FAILED - Configuration can't be processed as it looks outdated!
        You must have missed to run 'onecfg update' after previous OpenNebula upgrade.

        # onecfg status
        --- Versions ------------------------------
        OpenNebula:  5.12.0
        Config:      5.8.0
        ERROR: Configurations metadata are outdated.

Step 1 - Prepare Onecfg
--------------------------

Before upgrading OpenNebula, you need to ensure that state of Onecfg configuration tool is clean without any pending migrations from past or outdated configurations. Run ``onecfg status`` to check the configuration state.

Clean state might look like:

    .. prompt:: bash # auto

        # onecfg status
        --- Versions ------------------------------
        OpenNebula:  5.8.5
        Config:      5.8.0

        --- Available Configuration Updates -------
        No updates available.

Unknown Configuration Version Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If you get error message about unknown configuration version, you don't need to do anything. Configuration version will be automatically initialized during OpenNebuyla upgrade. Version of current configuration will be based on old OpenNebula version.

    .. prompt:: bash # auto

        # onecfg status
        --- Versions ------------------------------
        OpenNebula:  5.8.5
        Config:      unknown
        ERROR: Unknown config version

Configuration Metadata Outdated Error
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the ``onecfg`` tool complains about outdated metadata, you have missed to run configuration upgrade during some of OpenNebula upgrades in the past. Please note configuration must be upgraded or processed with even OpenNebula maintenance releases.

Following invalid state:

    .. prompt:: bash # auto

        # onecfg status
        --- Versions ------------------------------
        OpenNebula:  5.8.5
        Config:      5.8.0
        ERROR: Configurations metadata are outdated.

needs to be fixed by reinitialization of the configuration state. Any unprocessed upgrades will be lost and current state will be initialized based on your current OpenNebula version and configurations located in system directories.

    .. prompt:: bash # auto

        # onecfg init --force
        # onecfg status
        --- Versions ------------------------------
        OpenNebula:  5.8.5
        Config:      5.8.5

        --- Available Configuration Updates -------
        No updates available.

Step 2 - Upgrade OpenNebula
---------------------------

Update your OpenNebula packages by following **Upgrading from OpenNebula X.Y** document from official `OpenNebula Documentation <https://docs.opennebula.org/>`__ for the version you are upgrading to.

Take into account that step 5, "Update Configuration Files" is automated with ``onecfg``, so no need for manual configuration files editing as indicated in the public documentation guide. Onecfg configuration tool completely automates the step by running ``onecfg upgrade``. Follow :ref:`onecfg upgrade <cfg_upgrade>` documentation on how to upgrade and troubleshoot the configurations.

.. important::

   It's necessary to upgrade your current OpenNebula directly to **5.10.2** or later, which supports the automatic configuration backups. Also, configuration upgrade must be done after each OpenNebula upgrade!


After ``onecfg upgrade`` follow the rest steps from **Upgrading from OpenNebula X.Y** document. It might be necessary to upgrade database, or do some other OpenNebula version-specific steps.

Step 3 - Validation
-------------------

When all steps are done, run the OpenNebula and check the working state.

Check the configuration state via ``onecfg status``. There shouldn't be any errors and no new updates available. Your configuration should be current to the installed OpenNebula version. For example:

.. prompt:: bash # auto

    # onecfg status
    --- Versions ------------------------------
    OpenNebula:  5.12.0
    Config:      5.12.0

    --- Available Configuration Updates -------
    No updates available.
