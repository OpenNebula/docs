Bridged Networking
================================================================================

This guide describes how to deploy Bridged networks. In this mode virtual machine traffic is directly bridged through an existing Linux bridge in the nodes. Bridged networks can operate on three different modes depending on the additional traffic filtering made by OpenNebula:

* **Dummy**, no filtering is made
* **Security Group**, iptables rules are installed to implement security groups rules.
* **ebtables VLAN**, same as above plus additional ebtables rules to isolate (L2) each Virtual Networks.

Considerations & Limitations
================================================================================

The following needs to be considered regarding traffic isolation:

* In the **Dummy** and **Security Group** modes you can add tagged network interfaces to achieve network isolation. This is the **recommended** deployment strategy in production environments in this mode.

* The **ebtables VLAN** mode is targeted to small environments without proper hardware support to implement VLANS. Note that it is limited to /24 networks, and that IP addresses cannot overlap between Virtual Networks. This mode is only recommended for testing purposes.

OpenNebula Configuration
================================================================================

The following configuration attributes can be adjusted in ``/var/lib/one/remotes/etc/vnm/OpenNebulaNetwork.conf``:

+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Parameter        | Description                                                                               |
+==================+===========================================================================================+
| ipset_maxelem    | Maximal number of entries in the IP set (used for the security group rules)               |
+------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Defining a Bridged Network
================================================================================

To create a 802.1Q network include the following information:

+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| Attribute   | Value                                                                   | Mandatory |
+=============+=========================================================================+===========+
| **VN_MAD**  | * ``dummy`` for the Dummy Bridged mode                                  |  **YES**  |
|             | * ``fw`` for Bridged with Security Groups                               |           |
|             | * ``ebtables`` for Bridged with ebtables isolation                      |           |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+
| **BRIDGE**  | Name of the linux bridge in the nodes                                   |  **YES**  |
+-------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+-----------+

The following example defines Bridged network using the Security Groups mode:

.. code::

    NAME    = "bridged_net"
    VN_MAD  = "fw"
    BRIDGE  = vbr1
    ...

ebtables VLAN Mode: default rules
================================================================================

This section lists the ebtables rules that are created, in case you need to debug your setup

.. code::

    # Drop packets that don't match the network's MAC Address
    -s ! <mac_address>/ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:0 -o <tap_device> -j DROP
    # Prevent MAC spoofing
    -s ! <mac_address> -i <tap_device> -j DROP
