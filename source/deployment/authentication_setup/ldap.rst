====================
LDAP Authentication
====================

The LDAP Authentication add-on permits users to have the same credentials as in LDAP, so effectively centralizing authentication. Enabling it will let any correctly authenticated LDAP user to use OpenNebula.

Prerequisites
=============

.. warning:: This Add-on requires the **'net/ldap'** ruby library provided by the 'net-ldap' gem.

This Add-on will not install any LDAP server or configure it in any way. It will not create, delete or modify any entry in the LDAP server it connects to. The only requirement is the ability to connect to an already running LDAP server and being able to perform a successful **ldapbind** operation and have a user able to perform searches of users, therefore no special attributes or values are required in the LDIF entry of the user authenticating.

Configuration
=============

Configuration file for auth module is located at ``/etc/one/auth/ldap_auth.conf``. This is the default configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

    server 1:
        # Ldap user able to query, if not set connects as anonymous. For
        # Active Directory append the domain name. Example:
        # Administrator@my.domain.com
        #:user: 'admin'
        #:password: 'password'
     
        # Ldap authentication method
        :auth_method: :simple
     
        # Ldap server
        :host: localhost
        :port: 389

        # Connection and authentication timeout
        #:timeout: 15

        # Uncomment this line for tls connections
        #:encryption: :simple_tls
     
        # base hierarchy where to search for users and groups
        :base: 'dc=domain'
     
        # alternative base hierarchy where to search for groups instead of :base:
        #:group_base: 'ou=groups,dc=domain'

        # group the users need to belong to. If not set any user will do
        #:group: 'cn=cloud,ou=groups,dc=domain'
     
        # field that holds the user name, if not set 'cn' will be used
        :user_field: 'cn'
     
        # for Active Directory use this user_field instead
        #:user_field: 'sAMAccountName'

        # field name for group membership, by default it is 'member'
        #:group_field: 'member'

        # user field that that is in in the group group_field, if not set 'dn' will be used
        #:user_group_field: 'dn'

        # Generate mapping file from group template info
        :mapping_generate: true

        # Seconds a mapping file remain untouched until the next regeneration
        :mapping_timeout: 300

        # Name of the mapping file in OpenNebula var directory
        :mapping_filename: server1.yaml

        # Key from the OpenNebula template to map to an AD group
        :mapping_key: GROUP_DN

        # Default group ID used for users in an AD group not mapped
        :mapping_default: 1

        # use RFC2307bis for groups
        # if false, depending on your LDAP server configuration,
        # set user_field and user_group_field 'uid' and group_field 'memberUid'
        :rfc2307bis: true
     
    # this example server wont be called as it is not in the :order list
    server 2:
        :auth_method: :simple
        :host: localhost
        :port: 389
        :base: 'dc=domain'
        #:group: 'cn=cloud,ou=groups,dc=domain'
        :user_field: 'cn'
     
     
    # List the order the servers are queried
    #
    # :order is defined as a list of server names and/or nested lists
    # of server names (representing the availability group). The servers
    # in the main list are consulted in the order they are written until
    # the authentication succeeds. In the nested server lists (avail.
    # groups), user is authenticated only against the first online server.
    # If user is passed/refused by the server in the availability group,
    # no other server is consulted from the same group, but
    # the authentication process continues with the next server/group in
    # the main list.
    #
    # Examples:
    #
    # 1) simple list
    # :order:
    #     - server1
    #     - server2
    #     - server3
    #
    # 2) list with availability group
    # :order:
    #     - server1
    #     - ['server2', 'server3', 'server4']    # availability group
    #     - server5
    #
    :order:
        - server 1
        #- server 2

The structure is a hash where any key different to ``:order`` will contain the configuration of one LDAP server we want to query. The special key ``:order`` holds an array with the order we want to query the configured servers.

.. note:: Items of the ``:order`` are the server names or nested arrays of server names representing the **availability group**. The items in the ``:order`` are processed one by one until the user is successfully authenticated, or the end of the list is reached. Inside the availability group, only the very first server which can be successfully connected is queried. Any server not listed in ``:order`` won't be queried.

To enable ``ldap`` authentication the described parameters should be configured. OpenNebula must be also configured to enable external authentication. Add this line in ``/etc/one/oned.conf``

.. code-block:: bash

    DEFAULT_AUTH = "ldap"

User Management
===============

Using LDAP authentication module the administrator doesn't need to create users with ``oneuser`` command as this will be automatically done.

Users can store their credentials into ``$ONE_AUTH`` file (usually ``$HOME/.one/one_auth``) in this fashion:

.. code-block:: bash

    <user_dn>:ldap_password

where

-  ``<user_dn>`` the DN of the user in the LDAP service
-  ``ldap_password`` is the password of the user in the LDAP service

Alternatively a user can generate an authentication token using the ``oneuser login`` command, so there is no need to keep the LDAP password in a plain file. Simply input the ldap_password when requested. More information on the management of login tokens and ``$ONE_AUTH`` file can be found in :ref:`Managing Users Guide<manage_users_managing_users>`.

.. _ldap_dn_with_special_characters:

DN's With Special Characters
----------------------------

When the user dn or password contains blank spaces the LDAP driver will escape them so they can be used to create OpenNebula users. Therefore, users needs to set up their ``$ONE_AUTH`` file accordingly.

Users can easily create escaped $ONE\_AUTH tokens with the command ``oneuser encode <user> [<password>]``, as an example:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ oneuser encode 'cn=First Name,dc=institution,dc=country' 'pass word'
    cn=First%20Name,dc=institution,dc=country:pass%20word

The output of this command should be put in the ``$ONE_AUTH`` file.

.. _active_directory:

Active Directory
================

LDAP Auth drivers are able to connect to Active Directory. You will need:

-  Active Directory server with support for simple user/password authentication.
-  User with read permissions in the Active Directory user's tree.

You will need to change the following values in the configuration file (``/etc/one/auth/ldap_auth.conf``):

-  ``:user``: the Active Directory user with read permissions in the user's tree plus the domain. For example for user **Administrator** at domain **win.opennebula.org** you specify it as ``Administrator@win.opennebula.org``
-  ``:password``: password of this user
-  ``:host``: hostname or IP of the Domain Controller
-  ``:base``: base DN to search for users. You need to decompose the full domain name and use each part as DN component. Example, for ``win.opennebula.org`` you will get the base DN: DN=win,DN=opennebula,DN=org
-  ``:user_field``: set it to ``sAMAccountName``

.. _ldap_group_mapping:

Group Mapping
=============

You can make new users belong to an specific group or groups. To do this a mapping is generated from the LDAP group to an existing OpenNebula group. This system uses a mapping file specified by ``:mapping_file`` parameter and resides in OpenNebula ``var`` directory. The mapping file can be generated automatically using data in the group template that tells which LDAP group maps to that specific group. For example we can add in the group template this line:

.. code-block:: bash

    GROUP_DN="CN=technicians,CN=Groups,DC=example,DC=com"

And in the LDAP configuration file we set the ``:mapping_key`` to ``GROUP_DN``. This tells the driver to look for the group DN in that template parameter. This mapping expires the number of seconds specified by ``:mapping_timeout``. This is done so the authentication is not continually querying OpenNebula.

You can also disable the automatic generation of this file and do the mapping manually. The mapping file is in YAML format and contains a hash where the key is the LDAP's group DN and the value is the ID of the OpenNebula group. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    CN=technicians,CN=Groups,DC=example,DC=com: '100'
    CN=Domain Admins,CN=Users,DC=example,DC=com: '101'

When several servers are configured you should have different ``:mapping_key`` and ``:mapping_file`` values for each one so they don't collide. For example:

.. code-block:: yaml

    internal:
        :mapping_file: internal.yaml
        :mapping_key: INTERNAL_GROUP_DN

    external:
        :mapping_file: external.yaml
        :mapping_key: EXTERNAL_GROUP_DN

And in the OpenNebula group template you can define two mappings, one for each server:

.. code-block:: bash

    INTERNAL_GROUP_DN="CN=technicians,CN=Groups,DC=internal,DC=com"
    EXTERNAL_GROUP_DN="CN=staff,DC=other-company,DC=com"

.. note:: If the map is updated (e.g. you change the LDAP DB) the user groups will be updated next time the user is authenticated. Also note that a user maybe using a login token that needs to expire to this changes to take effect. The max. life time of a token can be set in oned.conf per each driver. If you want the OpenNebula core not to update user groups (and control group assigment from OpenNebula) update ``DRIVER_MANAGED_GROUPS`` in the ``ldap`` ``AUTH_MAD_CONF`` configuration attribute.

Enabling LDAP auth in Sunstone
==============================

Update the ``/etc/one/sunstone-server.conf`` :auth parameter to use the ``opennebula``:

.. code-block:: yaml

        :auth: opennebula

Using this method the credentials provided in the login screen will be sent to the OpenNebula core and the authentication will be delegated to the OpenNebula auth system, using the specified driver for that user. Therefore any OpenNebula auth driver can be used through this method to authenticate the user (i.e: LDAP).

To automatically encode credentials as explained in :ref:`DN's with special characters <ldap_dn_with_special_characters>` section also add this parameter to sunstone configuration:

.. code-block:: yaml

        :encode_user_password: true
