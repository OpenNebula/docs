===========
Basic Usage
===========

The support module comes with 2 specialized tools to

- :ref:`generate support diagnostic bundle <supp_bundle>`,
- :ref:`scan vCenter permissions <supp_perms>`.

.. _supp_bundle:

Generate Support Bundle
=======================

When there are no special requirements, the support diagnostic bundle can be generated just by running ``onesupport`` **on the front-end** without any extra parameters. The command must be running under privileged user (directly by root or via sudo). For example:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ sudo onesupport

The command generates a diagnostic bundle file and puts it into ``/tmp/``. The precise file location is shown at the end of the terminal output, e.g.:

.. prompt:: bash # auto

    Diagnostic archive: /tmp/onesupport.HNpsTCQSb.tar.xz

Please **attach this file to the support ticket**.

.. important::

   For most support issues it's enough to provide just a limited support bundle with front-end only specific information and without database dumps. The limited bundle can be generated by running:

    .. prompt:: bash $ auto

        $ sudo onesupport frontend nodb

The tool prints all actions, based on which you can decide if you want to provide such a bundle to the support team. Example full output:

.. code-block:: bash

    $ sudo onesupport
        ___  _ __   ___
       / _ \| '_ \ / _ \
      | (_) | | | |  __/     OpenNebula Support Tool
       \___/|_| |_|\___|

Follow the :ref:`advanced usage <supp_bundle_advanced>` guide to learn how to limit the information provided within the support bundle or how to use it on different hosts then frontend.

.. _supp_perms:

Scan vCenter Permissions
========================

When you are using OpenNebula cloud to manage vCenter infrastructure, it might be necessary to know also details about the permissions configuration inside vCenter. This is **automatically got during the support bundle preparation**, but can be scanned separately at any time (e.g., in case the automatic run fails).

Dedicated tool ``onesupport_vcenter_privs`` is used to gather permissions configuration.

.. important::

    The tool connects directly to your vCenter instance and must be provided with connection parameters.

Syntax:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ onesupport_vcenter_privs
    Usage: onesupport_vcenter_privs [arguments]

    Mandatory arguments:
      --host=name       .... vCenter hostname
      --user=name       .... vCenter login user name
      --password=text   .... vCenter password
      --check-user=name .... vCenter user for OpenNebula to check

Example run:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ onesupport_vcenter_privs --host=vcenter.localdomain \
        --user=administrator@vsphere.local --password=TopSecretPassword \
        --check-user=oneadmin@vsphere.local

The result is printed on the terminal (standard output). Can be redirected to the file, or just copy&pasted into the support ticket.
