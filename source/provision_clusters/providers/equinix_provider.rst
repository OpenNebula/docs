Equinix Provider
================================================================================

An Equinix provider contains the credentials to interact with Equinix and also the location to deploy your Provisions. OpenNebula comes with four pre-defined providers in the following regions:

* Amsterdam
* Parsippany (NJ, US)
* Tokyo
* California (US)

In order to define an Equinix provider, you need the following information:

* **Credentials**: these are used to interact with the remote provider. You need to provide ``token`` and ``project``. You can follow `this guide <https://metal.equinix.com/developers/api/>`__ to get this data.
* **Facility**: this is the location in the world where the resources are going to be deployed. All the available `facilities are listed here <https://www.equinix.com/data-centers/>`__.
* **Plans and OS**: these define the capacity of the resources that are going to be deployed and the operating system that is going to be installed on them.

.. warning:: Please note even though Equinix support multiple OSs, the automation tools are tailored to works with ``Ubuntu 20.04``. If you use another OS, please be aware that it might required some adjustments, and things might not work as expected. Avoid using a different OS in production environment unless you've properly tested it before.

How to Create an Equinix Provider
================================================================================

To add a new provider you need to write the previous data in YAML template:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ cat provider.yaml
    name: 'equinix-amsterdam'

    description: 'Edge cluster in Equinix Amsterdam'
    provider: 'equinix'

    plain:
       provision_type: 'metal'

    connection:
      token: 'Equinix token'
      project: 'Equinix project'
      facility: 'ams1'

    inputs:
      - name: 'equinix_os'
        type: 'list'
        default: 'ubuntu_20_04'
        options:
          - 'ubuntu_20_04'
      - name: 'equinix_plan'
        type: 'list'
        default: 't1.small'
        options:
          - 't1.small'
          - 'c1.small'
          - 'm1.xlarge'


Then you just need to use the command ``oneprovider create``:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

   $ oneprovider create provider.yaml
   ID: 0

The providers' templates are located in ``/usr/share/one/oneprovision/edge-clusters/metal/providers/equinix``. You just need to enter valid credentials.

.. include:: customize.txt

Insufficient capacity on Equinix Metal
================================================================================

Sometimes there may not be enough hardware available at a given Equinix Metal facility for a given machine type, in which case the following error is shown:

.. prompt::

    The facility ams1 has no provisionable c3.small.x86 servers matching your criteria

In this case, either select a different node type or Equinix Metal provider. You can check the current capacity status on the Equinix Metal API .
