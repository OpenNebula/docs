Activate the Provider (Virtual)
================================================================================

By default this provider and its associated provisions are disabled. To use it you need first to execute the following commands in the OpenNebula front-end as ``root`` user:

.. parsed-literal::

    ln -s /etc/one/fireedge/provision/providers.d-extra/\ |PROVIDER|\  /etc/one/fireedge/provision/providers.d
    ln -s /usr/share/one/oneprovision/edge-clusters-extra/virtual /usr/share/one/oneprovision/edge-clusters


The commands above will enable the specific provider and enable the virtual provisions, respectively.

.. note:: The second command is only required the first time you enable a virtual provider.
