OpenNebula Provisions is a tool to dynamically grow your cloud infrastructure with physical or virtual resources running on remote cloud providers. Provisions are used to support two main use cases:

* **Edge Cloud Computing**, to transition from centralized clouds to distributed edge-like cloud environments. You will be able to grow your on-premises cloud with resources at edge data center locations to meet the latency, bandwidth or data regulation needs of your workload.
* **Hybrid Cloud Computing**, to address peaks of demand and need for extra computing power by dynamically growing your underlying physical infrastructure.
