What's a HotFix Release?
================================================================================

A hotfix release is a type of incremental release that fixes specific issues.

While OpenNebula is fully open source, packages from hotfix incremental versions are not publicly released, and are only available for users with an active commercial subscription. However, rest assured that the code is publicly available in the `GitHub repository <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one>`__.

Hence, everyone can :ref:`build OpenNebula from the source code <compile>`, but only OpenNebula Systems customers have the convenience of pre-created packages for hotfix incremental releases.

If you are an OpenNebula Systems customer with an active support subscription, you have immediate access to this hotfix packages. Please check your private repository at `OpenNebula.pro <https://support.opennebula.pro>`__
