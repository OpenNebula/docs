Known Issues
================================================================================

A complete list of `known issues for OpenNebula is maintained here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22+label%3A%22Status%3A+Accepted%22>`__.

This page will be updated with relevant information about bugs affecting OpenNebula, as well as possible workarounds until a patch is officially published.

Drivers - Network
================================================================================

- Edge Cluster Public IP: NIC_ALIAS on the public network can only can only be associated to a NIC on the same network.

Drivers - Storage
================================================================================

- **LXC**, XFS formatted disk images are incompatible with the ``fs_lvm`` driver. The image `fails to be mounted <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/5802>`_ on the host.
- **OneStor**, recovery snapshots are no longer created after VM live migrate `5922 <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/5922>`_.
- **OneStor** does not work on AlmaLinux8 due to missing qcow2 type definition required by newer qemu-img command.

High Availability
================================================================================

HA server configuration synchronization with the command `onezone serversync` does not work for the PostgreSQL and SQLite DB Back-end

Sunstone
================================================================================

- Guacamole RDP as is currently shipped in OpenNebula does not support NLA authentication. You can follow `these instructions <https://www.parallels.com/blogs/ras/disabling-network-level-authentication/>`__ in order to disable NLA in the Windows box to use Guacamole RDP within Sunstone.
- When hidding the VM name setting on instantiate form, Sunstone does not continue with the instantintiation process. To be able to instantiate templates please set `VM.instantiate_name` to `true` in the corresponding YAML file.

Install Linux Graphical Desktop on KVM Virtual Machines
================================================================================

OpenNebula uses the ``cirrus`` graphical adapter for KVM Virtual Machines by default. It could happen that after installing a graphical desktop on a Linux VM, the Xorg window system does not load the appropriate video driver. You can force a VESA mode by configuring the kernel parameter ``vga=VESA_MODE`` in the GNU GRUB configuration file. `Here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions#Linux_video_mode_numbers/>`__ you can find the VESA mode numbers. For example, adding ``vga=791`` as kernel parameter will select the 16-bit 1024Ã—768 resolution mode.

vCenter Snapshot behavior
=================================

VMs in vCenter 7.0 exhibit a new behavior regarding snapshots and disks attach/detach operations. When vCenter 7.0 detects any change in the number of disks attached to a VM, it automatically cleans all the VM snapshots. OpenNebula doesn't take this into account yet, so the snapshots stated by OpenNebula, after a disk attach or disk detach, are pointing to a null vCenter reference, and as such, cannot be used. Please keep this in mind before a solution is implemented.

Virtual Machines Backup
================================================================================

When taking a VM backup, if the upload process fails and the app results in ERROR state, the backup will complete successfully. A detailed explanation can be found `here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/5454>`__.

Warning when Exporting an App from the Marketplace Using CLI
================================================================================

When exporting an application from the marketplace using the CLI the following warning can be seen:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    /usr/lib/one/ruby/opennebula/xml_element.rb:124: warning: Passing a Node as the second parameter to Node.new is deprecated. Please pass a Document instead, or prefer an alternative constructor like Node#add_child. This will become an error in a future release of Nokogiri.

This is harmless and can be discarded, it will be addressed in future releases.

Contextualization
=================

- ``GROW_ROOTFS`` and ``GROW_FS`` will not extend btrfs filesystems
- Debian 12 (pre-release) has an issue with ``systemd-networkd-wait-online`` which timeouts and delays contextualization

KVM - Live Memory Resize
================================================================================

For live memory resize user needs to specify ``MAX_MEMORY``, the available memory for the VM is in ``MEMORY`` attribute. But VM running Windows shows in Task Manager available physical memory as ``MAX_MEMORY`` although it can use only ``MEMORY``, this value is not visible in the Task Manager. Because of this it shows a high percentage of memory used. To double check the real available memory for the VM user should use command ``virsh dominfo <id>`` on the host.
