Known Issues
================================================================================

A complete list of `known issues for OpenNebula is maintained here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues?q=is%3Aopen+is%3Aissue+label%3A%22Type%3A+Bug%22+label%3A%22Status%3A+Accepted%22>`__.

This page will be updated with relevant information about bugs affecting OpenNebula, as well as possible workarounds until a patch is officially published.

Drivers - Storage
================================================================================

- As `part of the improvement of sparse file management <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/5058>`_ the file system datastore drivers use fallocate. Be aware that some filesystems may not implement fallocate(2), a `fix to deal with this situation has been committed here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/commit/ead26711f1611653ec40f565849b9ab373745a11>`__.

- The restore operation of a backup may cause the restored VM to get stuck in ``clone`` state. In this case, if the restored images are not in ``lock`` state you can simple terminate the VM and instantiate it again. A `fix that prevents this from happening is available here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/commit/3333b780ce6e3a757b595bd96aac6688a2a97e0f>`__.

- **Ceph**, OpenNebula 6.0 uses a consistent format scheme that reduces the need of setting ``DRIVER`` and ``FORMAT`` attributes. However existing images in Ceph Datastores may have a wrong value for these attributes. If the usage of these Images fails after upgrading to OpenNebula 6.0, please update Images in Ceph datastores to have ``FORMAT`` and ``DRIVER`` set to ``raw``. If any running VM is affected by this, ``onedb update-body`` command can be used for changing the corresponding values for the VM disks.

Drivers - Network
================================================================================

- If the nic-attach fails due to the libvirt bug (VM can not eject CD-ROM after reset) the nic appears in the VM (although without proper configuration) but it's not visible on OpenNebla VM `#5268 <http://dev.opennebula.org/issues/5268>`_
- OvSwitch networking driver won't clean LXC containers ports after destroying the containers. This will make resume operation to fail. `#5319 <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/5319>`_.
- Edge Cluster Public IP: NIC_ALIAS do not support security groups. Also NIC_ALIAS on the public network can only can only be associated to a NIC on the same network.

High Availability
================================================================================

HA server configuration synchronization with the command `onezone serversync` does not work for the PostgreSQL and SQLite DB Back-end

Sunstone
================================================================================

- Remote connections to Guacamole from Sunstone have a mouse related issue, however noVNC can still be used if needed.
- Guacamole RDP as is currently shipped in OpenNebula does not support NLA authentication. You can follow `these instructions <https://www.parallels.com/blogs/ras/disabling-network-level-authentication/>`__ in order to disable NLA in the Windows box to use Guacamole RDP within Sunstone.

Install Linux Graphical Desktop on KVM Virtual Machines
================================================================================

OpenNebubula uses the ``cirrus`` graphical adapter for KVM Virtual Machines by default.
It could happen that after installing a graphical desktop on a Linux VM, the Xorg window system does not load the appropriate video driver.
You can force a VESA mode by configuring the kernel parameter ``vga=VESA_MODE`` in the GNU GRUB configuration file.
`Here <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VESA_BIOS_Extensions#Linux_video_mode_numbers/>`__ you can find the VESA mode numbers.
For example, adding ``vga=791`` as kernel parameter will select the 16-bit 1024Ã—768 resolution mode.
