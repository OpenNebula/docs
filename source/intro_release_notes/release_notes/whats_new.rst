================================================================================

OpenNebula 7.0 “XXXX” is the first stable release of the OpenNebula 7 series. This release comes with many exciting features: integration with enterprise components (Veeam backup software, dedicated NetApp drivers, OVA import, LVM-thin drivers supporting any SAN vendor, revamped Sunstone interface (it's lush!), and many more.




OpenNebula Core
================================================================================

- The ability to import wild VMs into OpenNebula has been removed from code to provide a more coherent management experience across all interfaces and APIs.
- The enforce parameter has been restored for the resize operation. In this context, it only manages capacity enforcement checks (memory and CPU), while the NUMA topology is always verified independently.
- Option to define :ref:`Compute Quotas per Cluster <compute_quotas>` to achieve more granular control of resources.

Storage & Backups
================================================================================

- :ref:`Integrated NFS life-cycle setup <automatic_nfs_setup>` for volumes in shared datastore.

Sunstone
================================================================================

- Removed Provision/Provider as application :ref:`Sunstone <fireedge_sunstone>`.
- Architectural shift to Micro-Frontend as part of the Dynamic Tabs update :ref:`Sunstone development guide <sunstone_dev>`.
- Guacamole VDI over SSH tunnel :ref:`Remote connections guide <fireedge_remote_connections>`.

API and CLI

- Feature 2


Ecosystem
=========
