- **More customization**, now the admin can disable the VM advanced options in the :ref:`Cloud View dialogs <cloud_view_config>`.

Networking
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- New attribute for the networks called **BRIDGE_TYPE** for defining the brdiging technology used by the driver. More info :ref:`here <devel-nm>`.

Virtual Machine management
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Automatic selection of Virtual Networks** for VM NICs. Based on the usual requirements and rank the Scheduler can pick the rigth Network for a NIC. You can use this feature to balance network usage at deployment time or to reduce clutter in your VM Template list, as you do not need to duplicate VM Templates for different networks. More info :ref:`here <vgg_vm_vnets>`.
