OneFlow & OneGate
===============================================================================
- **Remove attributes from VMs**, the onegate server API supports a new option to delete attributes from VM user template :ref:`via onegate command <onegate_usage>`.

CLI
================================================================================
- **Better output for CLI tools**, new options to adjust and expand the output to the terminal size, also it allow better parsing of output, :ref:`check the documentation (expand, adjust and size attributes) for more details <cli>`.
