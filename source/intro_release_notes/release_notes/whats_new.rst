OpenNebula 5.12 (Firework) is the seventh stable release of the OpenNebula 5 series. The main focus has been to better support cloud infrastructures with several thousands of physical hosts, running tens of thousands of VMs, distributed cloud/edge and HA deployments, and micro-VMs for innovative serverless deployments and secure multi-tenant container-based services.

There are plenty of very nice perks! The highlights of “Firework” are:

- The `much-announced integration <https://opennebula.io/opennebula-firecracker-building-the-future-of-on-premises-serverless-computing/>`__ with **Firecracker** for supporting innovative serverless deployments. Firecracker is a virtual machine manager widely used by Amazon Web Services (AWS) and designed for managing lots of tiny virtual machines (micro-VMs) on a server. Here you can couple the security of traditional VMs with the agility of containers, combining different workloads on the same OpenNebula instance.

- It also brings seamless integration with the **Docker Hub Marketplace**, permitting direct execution of Docker Hub images using KVM/LXD/Firecracker hypervisors in your OpenNebula cloud. This brings all of the current application container management right square in-line with OpenNebula. More information on how to use it with different hypervisors can be found :ref:`here <container_image_usage>`.

- **New monitoring subsystem**, able to **scale to thousands of physical hosts and tens of thousands of VMs** and better **support hypervisors at cloud/edge locations and HA deployments**. This re-design decouples DB access for monitoring and VM/Host data to improve *oned* response time and overall monitor processing time. Additionally, the host monitor agents have been improved to better report VM state changes and optimize network usage.

- **OneFlow has been revamped** to use the hook mechanism for VM monitoring rendering significant performance improvements. It also includes new functionality like automatic network creation when a service is deployed, support for fenced networking to map an external and internal network, as well as batch operations on all VMs of the service or a particular role. The new incarnation of OneFlow **reduces times for service deployment (1m to 11s), scaling (1m20s to 15s) and failure (23s to 1s)**.

- **NSX integrated with the Security Groups functionality**. This opens the door to manage inbound/outbound network traffic with L3 rules, using the power of NSX within OpenNebula.

- **New ways of remote accessing your VMs in Sunstone**. Better SPICE integration with the possibility of spawning an external virt-viewer program, as well as the possibility of automatically authenticating on a Windows VM using a RDP client from Sunstone.

As usual, the OpenNebula 5.12 codename refers to a nebula, in this case the `Firework Nebula <https://opennebula.io/the-firework-nebula/>`__, the result of a type of stellar explosion called a nova. In a nova, a nuclear detonation on the surface of a compact white dwarf star blasts away material that has been dumped on its surface by a companion star. Also known as GK Persei or Nova Persei 1901, this nova became one of the brightest stars in the night sky in the year 1901—almost as bright as your OpenNebula cloud ;). More on this in this `excellent blog post <https://opennebula.io/the-firework-nebula/>`__.

OpenNebula 5.12 Firework is considered to be a stable release and as such it is available to update production environments.

In the following list you can check the highlights of OpenNebula 5.12 (a detailed list of changes can be found `here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/milestone/28?closed=1>`__):
