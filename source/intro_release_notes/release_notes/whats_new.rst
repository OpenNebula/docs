**This is the stable release of OpenNebula 5.10**

OpenNebula 5.10 (Boomerang) is the sixth major release of the OpenNebula 5 series. The main focus has been to enforce functionality to manage NFVs (as well as other workloads) to propel OpenNebula as the default orchestrator of choice to build clouds in the edge and in environments where network performance is key. Also this focus on networking explains the new NSX integration over VMware infrastructures, which enables very interesting use cases in vSphere. The highlights of Boomerang are:

  - **NUMA and CPU pinning**, define in which NUMA node VMs are going to be deployed.
  - **NSX integration**, create and consume NSX networks from within OpenNebula.
  - **Revamped hook subsystem**, hook a script for any API call or change of state in any VM or host resource.
  - **DPDK support**, dramatically increase performance in network hungry, densely packed VMs.
  - **2FA Authentication** for Sunstone.

As usual, the OpenNebula 5.10 codename refers to a nebula, in this case the `Boomerang Nebula <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang_Nebula>`__, a protoplanetary nebula located 5,000 light-years away from Earth in the constellation Centaurus. It is also known as the Bow Tie Nebula and catalogued as LEDA 3074547. The nebula's temperature is measured at 1 K (-272.15 °C; -457.87 °F) making it the coolest natural place currently known in the Universe. Same as OpenNebula in the IaaS space :)

OpenNebula 5.10 Boomerang is considered to be a stable release and as such it is available to update production environments.

In the following list you can check the highlights of OpenNebula 5.10. (A detailed list of changes can be found `here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/milestone/23?closed=1>`__.)

OpenNebula Core
================================================================================
- **Update hashing algorithm**: Now passwords and login tokens are hashed using sha256 instead of sha1. Also csrftoken is now hashed with SHA256 instead of MD5
- **NUMA and CPU pinning**: You can define virtual NUMA topologies and pin them to specific hypervisor resources. NUMA and pinning is an important feature to improve the performance of specific workloads. :ref:`You can read more here <numa>`.
- **Live update of context information**: Running VMs can update their context information and trigger the contextualization scripts in the guests, :ref:`see here <vm_updateconf>`.
- **Uniform thread-safe random generator**: For random numbers use a Mersenne Twister generator with uniform distribution.
- **VM operations configurable at user and group level**: Use attributes ``VM_USE_OPERATIONS``, ``VM_MANAGE_OPERATIONS`` and ``VM_ADMIN_OPERATIONS`` in the user or group template, :ref:`more information <oned_conf_vm_operations>`
- **Unified objects' secrets handling**: Secrets are encrypted and decrypted in core, drivers get secrets decrypted `see here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/3064>`__.
- **Allow VM reschedule in poweroff state**: `See here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/3298>`__.
- **System wide CPU model configuration**: The default CPU model for KVM can be set in config file :ref:`see here <kvmg_default_attributes>`.
- **KVM configuration per Host or Cluster**: All :ref:`kvm default attributes <kvmg_default_attributes>` can be overriden in Cluster and Host.
- **Revamped Hook System**: A more flexible and powerful hook system has been developed for 5.10. Now you can hook on any :ref:`API call <api_hooks>` as well as :ref:`state changes <state_hooks>`

Other minor features in OpenNebula core:

- `FILTER is now a VM_RESTRICTED attribute <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/3092>`__.

Storage
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sunstone
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
- **Two Factor Authentication**: With this method, not only does it request a username and password, it also requires a token generated by any of these applications: Google Authentication, Authy or Microsoft Authentication. :ref:`You can read more here <2f_auth>`.


vCenter
===============================================================================

- All VMM driver actions receive relevant information through stdin, saving oned calls enhancing performance.
