**OpenNebula 6.10 “Bubble”** is the sixth stable release of the OpenNebula 6 series. This new release features the first complete implementation of the Sunstone UI functionality on the FireEdge server, as well as improvements in backups, support for new versions of operating systems for the Front-end node, new features included in the Community Edition, and streamlining by removing obsolete or little-used components, or providing them as legacy components.

The first major highlight in this release is the new Sunstone UI. The full power of OpenNebula’s web UI is now provided by the FireEdge server, which delivers the complete set of features previously offered by legacy Ruby-based Sunstone. The new Sunstone UI brings a clean, fast, highly-customizable and easy-to-use UI.

The Sunstone UI provided by FireEdge is now the default. The Ruby-based Sunstone UI is included in this release as a legacy component, but will not be updated with new features or receive maintenance, and will be removed in a future release.

The second highlight in this release is improved backup functionality, thanks to the addition of the **in-place restore** backup mode. This feature replaces the old procedure for restoring a VM from a backup, and allows you to replace the disks of a VM with a backup copy without manually generating new images and VM templates. The feature is available through the CLI and the Sunstone UI, where it can be easily accessed in the Host controls for the selected VM (in **Instances** -> **VMs**).

This release also includes myriad improvements in core functionality, the API and CLI; such as support for PCI attach and detach operations, improved OneFlow message logging, and new functionality for searching for VMs.

Finally, OpenNebula is being streamlined by removing obsolete or little-used components. The following table lists components no longer included in the OpenNebula distribution, as well as their alternative components:

Beginning on version 6.10, users of the :ref:`Community Edition <what_is_community>` can access two features previously only available in the Enterprise Edition:

   * **Backups** using `Restic <https://restic.net/>`__, an open source backup program designed for speed and security. The Community Edition now includes the possibility of using Restic as a backend for backup operations.
   * **System monitoring** using `Prometheus <https://prometheus.io/>`__, a set of open source monitoring and alerting tools. The Community edition now includes the possibility of using Prometheus as a backend for monitoring infrastructure.

OpenNebula 6.10 is named after the `Bubble Nebula <https://www.constellation-guide.com/bubble-nebula-ngc-7635/>`__ (NGC 7635) in the constellation Cassiopeia. It is a young, glowing emission nebula energized by a hot, massive central star. Partly located in a group of stars between 7000 and 8000 light-years away from Earth, the Bubble Nebula is in expansion, with a central “bubble” measuring between six and ten light-years and an estimated temperature of more than 37,000 degrees Celsius (67,000 Fahrenheit). It was discovered by the celebrated astronomer William Herschel in 1787.

We’d like to thank all the people that :ref:`support the project<acknowledgements>`, OpenNebula is what it is thanks to its community! Please keep rocking.

OpenNebula Core
================================================================================
- **Generic Quotas**: Option to specify :ref:`custom quotas for OpenNebula VMs, <quota_auth_generic>`
- **PCI attach/detach**: generic PCI devices (e.g. GPU/vGPUs) now support :ref:`attach and detach operations <vm_guide2_pci>` in poweroff and undeployed states. Note that this functionality (in any state) is already present for NIC PCI passthrough/SRIOV devices.
- **Search Virtual Machines**: The new :ref:`JSON search syntax <vm_search>` allow advanced search by ``onevm list --search`` command. It also greatly improves the performance of  searches. See also the :ref:`compatibility notes <compatibility>`.
- **Additional settings at cluster level**: The ``FEATURES`` attribute for ``CPU_MODEL`` can be :ref:`set at cluster level <kvmg_default_attributes>` so all VMs running in a given cluster will use the same CPU features by default.
- **Warning attribute for Scheduled Action**: The ``WARNING`` attribute can be used to highlight the :ref:`Scheduled Action <template_schedule_actions>` in the CLI and Sunstone, before it is executed.

Storage & Backups
================================================================================
- **In-place restore**: Users now have access to a streamlined operation for restoring VM disk backups directly onto existing VMs, eliminating the need of generating new images and VM templates. For further information, please refer to the :ref:`backup documentation <vm_backups_restore>`.
- **Restic** driver has been included in the CE and updated to version 0.16.5
