Containers
==========

MicroVMs
========

DockerHub
==========
- Dockerfiles used to download images from DockerHub have been moved to external templates so they can be customized. You can find them under ``/usr/share/one/dockerhub`` directory.
- Export of Docker Hub images into OpenNebula preferably uses FUSE based ext2/3/4 mounts on front-end, instead of kernel native mounts.
- Add support to create images from Dockerfile specification. Check :ref:`this <dockerfile>` for more information.

MarketPlace
===========

- Add support for service templates, check :ref:`this <marketapp_import>` for more information.

Hooks
=====
- Change the way arguments are passed to ``host_error.rb`` from command line to standard input to avoid potential argument overflow `issue <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/5101>`__. When upgrading from previous OpenNebula versions, if :ref:`Host Failures <ftguide>` configured, it is needed to update the hook (``onehook update``) with ``ARGUMENTS_STDIN = "yes"``.
