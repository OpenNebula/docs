Compatibility Guide
====================

This guide is aimed at OpenNebula 6.6.x users and administrators who want to upgrade to the latest version. The following sections summarize the new features and usage changes that should be taken into account, or are prone to cause confusion. You can check the upgrade process in the :ref:`corresponding section <upgrade>`. If upgrading from previous versions, please make sure you read all the intermediate versions' Compatibility Guides for possible pitfalls.

Visit the :ref:`Features list <features>` and the :ref:`What's New guide <whats_new>` for a comprehensive list of what's new in OpenNebula 7.0.

..
    Database
    =========================
    - The table ``vm_pool`` now contains the column ``json_body`` which provides searching for values using JSON keys, and no longer contains the ``search_token`` column, effectively removing FULLTEXT searching entirely. This should greatly improve performance when performing search filters on virtual machines as well as remove the need for regenerating FULLTEXT indexing.  Due to this change, the search now uses a JSON path to search, for example: ``VM.NAME=production`` would match all VM's which have name containing ``production``.
    - The migrator has been updated to make these changes automatically with the ``onedb upgrade`` tool. When tested on a database containing just over 150,000 VM entries, the upgrade took roughly 4100 seconds using an HDD and about 3500 seconds using a ramdisk.

Configuration Files Headers
================================================================================

In order to avoid breaking compatibility with older versions of OpenNebula headers have been removed from all the configuration files. This change will be taken care transparently by the onecfg tool, but it will show in manual diffs with older versions of the configuration files.

Datastore & Transfer Manager Drivers Arguments
================================================================================

Datastore driver actions take the information from stdin to prevent a ``Argument list too long`` error when there is a large number of images in a datastore. All configuration and driver files has been updated and no special action needs to be performed. However if you have develop your own datastore drivers those should be updated accordingly.

The backup operation now includes a new argument to accommodate the backup jobs. This shifts the vm_id and ds_id one position to preserve the convention across actions. Additionally the backup URLs (``restic://`` and ``rsync://``) also include the backup job id, that also changes the position of some URL tokes. This will only affect to custom backup drivers.

KVM and Shared/Qcow2 Transfer Manager Drivers
================================================================================

In order to implement the disk-snapshot delete operation (via `virsh blockcommit/blockpush` and `qemu-img rebase`) some internal changes has been made, namely:

- KVM deployment files are re-written on the fly to resolve the `disk.<disk_id>` symbolic links. This solves an issue that prevents a correct `backingStore` to be constructed by libvirt for the VMs.
- When a snapshot is deleted (`<vm_folder>/disk.<disk_id>.snap/<snap_id>`) some times it is necessary to adjust actual file names supporting a given snapshot. In this case a file ended by `.current` is created. All related operations have been updated to react to the presence of this file.

This changes are not exposed by any OpenNebula interface and are not an issue for any existing VM while upgrading your cloud.

CLI
================================================================================

Some CLI commands that accept template files are able to receive the same template via STDIN, thus bypassing the need of a temporary file to hold the template contents. This means the file argument is now optional
and the OpenNebula CLI will check for STDIN if the file argument is missing. The template must have bash symbols like ``$`` escaped, these are used for TEMPLATE references.

Restricted Attributes
================================================================================

Previous versions of OpenNebula silently ignored the removal of restricted attributes. However, with the `resolution of the issue 6315 <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/6315>`_, an error will be generated always in such cases.

Labels
================================================================================

In previous versions of OpenNebula, label casing was consistently preserved. However, starting with version 6.8.0, in light of enhancements to our filtering system, we've transitioned to standardizing label names in uppercase.
This change ensures better system consistency and performance. For a more detailed overview of this change you can refer to the `related discussion here <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/5134>`_.

To ensure a seamless experience for our users, we've introduced `a migrator in this update <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one/issues/6002>`_, which automatically handles the transition.

OneGate Proxy
================================================================================

We are actively developing an enhanced version of the OneGate Proxy implementation that comes with reduced requirements. Starting from release 6.8.3, we strongly recommend disabling this component and following the recommened network configuration outlined in :ref:`the OneGate Configuration guide <onegate_conf>`.

Check Datastore Capacity During Image Create
================================================================================

We fixed and synchronized usage of the ``no_check_capacity`` flag across all APIs (XML-RPC, CLI, Ruby, Java, Python). Now it works as described in the :ref:`XML-RPC API documentation <api>`. If you are using this flag in any of the API bindings provided for OpenNebula please make sure you update your code.
