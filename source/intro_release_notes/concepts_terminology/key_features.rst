(\*) *Because OpenNebula leverages the functionality exposed by the underlying platform services, its functionality and performance may be affected by the limitations imposed by those services.*

-  *The list of features may change on the different platform configurations*
-  *Not all platform configurations exhibit a similar performance and stability*
-  *The features may change to offer users more features and integration with other virtualization and cloud components*
-  *The features may change due to changes in the functionality provided by underlying virtualization services*
