Try OpenNebula on VMware
========================

In this guide, we'll go through a Front-end OpenNebula environment deployment, where all the OpenNebula services needed to use, manage and run the cloud will be deployed through an OVA and collocated on the single VM running on a vCenter instance. Later, we'll import some vCenter resources and launch a VM Template. Afterwards, you can follow the Operations and Usage basics guides of this same Quick Start to launch edge clusters based on open source hypervisors.

OpenNebula over VMware is intended for companies willing to create a self-service cloud environment on top of their VMware infrastructure without having to abandon their investment in VMware and retool the entire stack. In these environments, OpenNebula seamlessly integrates with existing vCenter infrastructures to leverage advanced features such as vMotion, HA or DRS. OpenNebula exposes a multi-tenant, cloud-like provisioning layer on top of vCenter, enabling you to take steps towards liberating your stack from vendor lock-in. Once you have built your cloud with OpenNebula on VMware, you can then add new resources based on open source hypervisors ⁠— like KVM — and hence use OpenNebula as a migration framework to the open cloud.

vOneCloud is a virtual appliance for vSphere that builds on top of your vCenter an OpenNebula cloud for development, testing or product evaluation in five minutes. In a nutshell, it is an OVA file with a configured CentOS and OpenNebula installation ready to import resources from vCenter environments. vOneCloud is free to download and use. The virtual appliance does not interfere with existing vSphere configurations, procedures and workflows. This means that you can try it and if you decide not to adopt it, you can just delete it. vOneCloud can be also used for small-size production deployments.

vOneCloud ships with the following components under the hood:

+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|       **CentOS**      |                                                8                                                 |

| **OpenNebula**        | |release| (release notes <intro_release_notes/release_notes/index.html>)                         |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **MariaDB**           | Default version shipped in CentOS 8                                                              |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| **Phusion Passenger** | Default version shipped in EPEL 8 (used to run Sunstone)                                         |
+-----------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _control_console:

vOneCloud comes with a Control Console, a text-based wizard accessible through the vCenter console to the vOneCloud appliance. It is available by opening the vOneCloud appliance console in vCenter. It requires no authentication since only the vCenter administrator will be able to open the vOneCloud console. It can be used to configure the network, root password and change the password of the OpenNebula oneadmin user.

.. _vonecloud_requirements:

Requirements
============

It is advised to manage one vCenter through one OpenNebula only (i.e., do not manage the same vCenter from two different OpenNebulas). If you do, VMs from both servers will clash and produce errors.

The following components need to be present in the infrastructure to implement a cloud infrastructure run by OpenNebula:

+---------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|             **Component**             |                                                                                                                                                      **Observations**                                                                                                                                                     |

|                                       | - DRS is not required but it is recommended. OpenNebula does not schedule to the granularity of ESX hosts and you would need DRS to select the actual ESX host within the cluster. Otherwise the VM will be started in the ESX host associated with the VM Template.                                                      |
|                                       | - VMs that will be instantiated through OpenNebula need to be saved as VMs Templates in vCenter.

To enable VNC functionality, please follow these :ref:`instructions <vnc_one_esx_hosts>`.

vOneCloud ships with a default of 1 vCPUs and 2.5 GiB of RAM, and as such it has been certified for infrastructures of the following dimensions:

- Up to 4 vCenters
- Up to 40 ESXs managed by each vCenter
- Up to 1.000 VMs in total, each vCenter managing up to 250 VMs
- Up to 100 users, the limit being 10 users accessing the system simultaneously

Take into account that vOneCloud is shipped for evaluation purposes. For infrastructures exceeding the aforementioned limits we recommend an installation of OpenNebula from scratch on a bare-metal server, using the vCenter drivers.

.. _accounts:

Accounts
================================================================================

vOneCloud ships with several pre-created user accounts which will be described in this section:

+----------+---------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Account  |      Interface      |           Role          |                                   Description                                    |
+==========+=====================+=========================+==================================================================================+
| root     | linux               | Appliance administrator | This user can log into the appliance (local login, no SSH).                      |
+----------+---------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| oneadmin | linux               | Service user            | Used to run all OpenNebula services.                                             |
+----------+---------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| oneadmin | OpenNebula Sunstone | Cloud administrator     | Cloud administrator. Run any task in OpenNebula, including creating other users. |
+----------+---------------------+-------------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. _download_and_deploy:

Download and Deploy
================================================================================

vOneCloud can be downloaded by completing the form `here <https://opennebula.io/get-vonecloud>`__.

The OVA file can be imported into an existing vCenter infrastructure. It is based on `CentOS 8 <http://www.centos.org/>`__ and has VMware tools enabled.

Follow the next steps to deploy a fully functional OpenNebula cloud.

Step 1. Deploying the OVA
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Log in to your vCenter installation and select the appropriate datacenter and cluster where you want to deploy the appliance. Select ``Deploy OVF Template``.

.. image:: /images/vOneCloud-download-deploy-001.png
    :align: center

Browse to the download path of the OVA that can be downloaded from the link above.

Select the name, folder, and a compute resource where you want vOneCloud to be deployed. Also, you'll need to select the datastore in which to copy the OVA.

Select the network. You will need to choose a network that has access to the ESX hosts.

Review the settings selection and click finish. Wait for the Virtual Machine to appear in the cluster.

.. image:: /images/vOneCloud-download-deploy-007.png
    :align: center

After importing the vOneCloud OVA and before powering it on, the vOneCloud Virtual Machine can be edited to, for instance, add a new network interface, increase the amount of RAM, the available CPUs for performance, etc.

Now you can power on the Virtual Machine.

.. _download_and_deploy_control_console:

Step 2. vOneCloud Control Console - Initial Configuration
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When the VM boots up you will see in the VM console in vCenter the :ref:`vOneCloud Control Console <control_console>`, showing this wizard:

.. image:: /images/control-console.png
    :align: center

If you are presented instead with the following:

.. image:: /images/control-console-wrong.png
    :align: center

You are being presented with the wrong tty. You will need to press Ctrl+Alt+F1 to access the Control Console.

In this wizard you first need to **configure the network**. If you are using DHCP you can simply skip to the next item.

If you are using a static network configuration, answer yes and you will need to use a ncurses interface to:

- "Edit a connection"
- Select "System eth0"
- Change IPv4 CONFIGURATION from <Automatic> to <Manual> and select "Show"
- Input the desired IP address/24 in Addresses
- Input Gateway and DNS Servers
- Select OK and then quit the dialog

Here's an example of static network configuration on the available network interface on the 10.0.1.x class C network, with a gateway in 10.0.1.1 and using 8.8.8.8 as the DNS server:

.. image:: /images/network-conf-example.png
    :align: center

The second action needed is to set the **oneadmin account password**. You will need this to log in to OpenNebula. Check the :ref:`Accounts section <accounts>` to learn more about vOneCloud roles and users.

.. image:: /images/set_oneadmin_password.png
    :align: center

.. _advanced_login:

In the third step, you need to define a **root password.** You won't be using this very often, so write it down somewhere safe. It's your master password to the appliance.

This password can be used to access the OpenNebula command line interface; for that, you need to SSH to vOneCloud using the `root` account and password. In OS X and Linux environments, simply use `ssh` to log in to the root account of vOneCloud's IP. For Windows environments you can use software like `PuTTY <http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/download.html>`__ or even SFTP clients like `WinSCP <https://winscp.net/>`__. Alternatively, open the console of the vOneCloud VM in vCenter and change the tty (Ctrl + Alt + F2).

As the last step, you need to configure a public-facing address that will be used to access your vOneCloud instance by end-users. Enter the fully qualified domain name, hostname valid within your network, or the IP address.

.. image:: /images/control-console-fe-endpoint.png
    :align: center

Step 3. Enjoy the Out-of-the-Box Features
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

After opening the Sunstone interface (``http://<appliance_ip>`` with oneadmin credentials), you are now ready to enjoy the out-of-the-box features of OpenNebula!

.. image:: /images/sunstone-main.png
    :align: center

If Sunstone greets you with an error while connecting to the public FireEdge endpoint, return to Control Center in the previous step and configure a valid endpoint:

.. image:: /images/sunstone-fe-error.png
    :align: center

.. _import_vcenter:

Import Existing vCenter Resources
=================================

Importing a vCenter infrastructure into OpenNebula can be carried out easily through the Sunstone Web UI. Follow the next steps to import an existing vCenter cluster as well as any already defined VM Template and Networks.

You will need the IP or hostname of the vCenter server, as well as a user declared as Administrator in vCenter. There's more info on needed permissions in the :ref:`vCenter node installation guide <vcenter_permissions_requirement>`.

.. note:: For security reasons, you may define different users to access different ESX Clusters. A different user can be defined in OpenNebula per ESX cluster, which is encapsulated in OpenNebula as an OpenNebula Host.

Step 1. Sunstone login
-----------------------

Log in to Sunstone as **oneadmin**, as explained in :ref:`the previous section <download_and_deploy>`.

The *oneadmin* account has full control of all the physical and virtual resources.

.. _acquire_resources:

Step 2. Import vCenter Cluster
------------------------------

To import new vCenter clusters to be managed in OpenNebula, proceed in Sunstone to the ``Infrastructure --> Hosts`` tab and click on the "+" green icon.

.. image:: /images/import_host.png
    :align: center

.. warning:: OpenNebula does not support spaces in vCenter cluster names.

In the dialog that pops up, select vCenter as Type in the drop-down. You now need to fill in the data according to the following table:

+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Hostname** | vCenter hostname (FQDN) or IP address                |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **User**     | Username of a vCenter user with administrator rights |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+
| **Password** | Password for the above user                          |
+--------------+------------------------------------------------------+

Select the vCenter cluster to import as OpenNebula Host and click on "Import". After importing you should see a message indicating that the Host was successfully imported.

.. _import_running_vms:

Now it's time to check that the vCenter import has been successful. In ``Infrastructure --> Hosts`` check if the vCenter cluster has been imported, and if all the ESX Hosts are available in the ESX tab.

.. note:: Take into account that one vCenter cluster (with all its ESX Hosts) will be represented as one OpenNebula Host. It's not possible to import individual ESX Hosts; they need to be grouped in vCenter clusters.

Step 3. Import Datastores
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. _import_images_and_ds:

Datastores can be imported from the ``Storage --> Datastores`` Since datastores are going to be used to hold the images from VM Templates, all datastores **must** be imported before VM Template import.

vCenter datastores hosts VMDK files and other file types so VMs and templates can use them, and these datastores can be represented in OpenNebula as both an Images Datastore and a System Datastore:

- Images Datastore. Stores the images repository. VMDK files are represented as OpenNebula images stored in this datastore.
- System Datastore. Holds disk for running virtual machines, copied or cloned from the Images Datastore.

For example, if we have a vcenter datastore called ''nfs'', when we import the vCenter datastore into OpenNebula, two OpenNebula datastores will be created as an Images Datastore and as a System Datastore pointing to the same vCenter datastore.

First go to ``Storage --> Datastores`` , click on the "+" green icon and click on "Import". Select the Host (vCenter cluster) and click on "Get Datastores".

.. image:: /images/import_datastore_getDatastores.png
    :align: center

Select the datastore to import and click on "Import". After importing you should see a message indicating that the datastore was successfully imported.

.. note:: If the vCenter instance features a read-only datastore, please be aware that you should disable the SYSTEM representation of the datastore after importing it to avoid OpenNebula trying to deploy VMs in it.

.. _import_networks:

Step 4. Import Networks
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Similarly, Port Groups, Distributed Port Groups and NSX-T / NSX-V logical switches, can also be imported using a similar ``Import`` button in ``Network --> Virtual Networks``.

Select the Host and click on "Get Networks". Select the Network and click on ``Import``. After importing you should see a message indicating that the network was successfully imported.

.. image:: /images/import_vnet_import_success.png
    :align: center

Virtual Networks can be further refined with the inclusion of different Address Ranges. This refinement can be done at import time, defining the size of the network using one of the following supported Address Ranges:

- IPv4: Need to define at least starting IP address. MAC address can be defined as well
- IPv6: Can optionally define starting MAC address, GLOBAL PREFIX, and ULA PREFIX
- Ethernet: Does not manage IP addresses but rather MAC addresses. If a starting MAC is not provided, OpenNebula will generate one.

.. _import_vm_templates:

Step 5. Import VM Templates
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

.. warning:: Since datastores are going to be used to hold the images from VM Templates, all datastore **must** be imported before VM Template import.

In OpenNebula, Virtual Machines are deployed from VMware VM Templates that must exist previously in vCenter and must be imported into OpenNebula. There is a one-to-one relationship between each VMware VM Template and the equivalent OpenNebula VM Template. Users will then instantiate the OpenNebula VM Template and OpenNebula will create a Virtual Machine clone from the vCenter template.

vCenter **VM Templates** can be imported and reacquired using the ``Import`` button in ``Templates --> VMs``.

.. image:: /images/import_template.png
    :align: center

Select the Host and click on "Get Templates". Select the template to import and click on "Import".

.. _operations_on_templates:
.. _vmtemplates_and_networks:

When a VMware VM Template is imported, OpenNebula will detect any virtual disk and network interface within the template. For each virtual disk, OpenNebula will create an image representing each disk discovered in the template. In the same way, OpenNebula will create a network representation for each standard or distributed port group associated with virtual network interfaces found in the template. The imported OpenNebula VM templates can be modified by selecting the VM Template in ``Virtual Resources --> Templates`` and clicking on the Update button.

If the vCenter infrastructure has running or powered off **Virtual Machines**, OpenNebula can import and subsequently manage them. To import vCenter VMs, proceed to the **Wilds** tab in the Host info tab representing the vCenter cluster the VMs are running in, select the VMs to be imported and click on the import button.

.. _operations_on_running_vms:

After the VMs are in the running state, you can operate on their life-cycle, assign them to particular users, attach or detach network interfaces, create snapshots, do capacity resizing (change CPU and MEMORY after powering the VMs off), etc.

.. _cluster_prefix:

.. note:: Resources imported from vCenter will have their names appended with the name of the cluster where these resources belong in vCenter, to ease their identification within OpenNebula.

Step 6. Verification - Launch a VM
---------------------------------------------------------------

Let's check out this OpenNebula installation doing what it does best: launching Virtual Machines. Go to your ``Instances -> VMs`` tab in Sunstone and click on the "+" green icon. Select the VM Template imported in the previous step (feel free to change any configuration aspect) and click on Create.

.. image:: /images/instantiate_vcenter_vm_template.png
    :align: center

OK! Your VM should be up and running switfly. Check the console icon to access your VM through VMRC within Sunstone.

Now you can proceed to :ref:`Operations Basics <operation_basics>` to launch an edge cluster on a public cloud provider.
