So we heard you want to try out OpenNebula? Welcome! You are in the right place.

This Quick Start guide will guide you through the process to achieve a fully functional OpenNebula cloud.

In particular, Deployment Basic will get you an OpenNebula Front-end, ready to rock. First, please choose your fighter:

- If you are interested in OpenNebula over open source hypervisors, proceed to the :ref:`Try OpenNebula on KVM, LXC or Firecracker <try_opennebula_on_kvm>` guide.
- If you are interested in OpenNebula over VMware hypervisors, proceed to the :ref:`Try OpenNebula on VMware <try_opennebula_on_vmware>` guide.

Afterwards, you can move on to :ref:`Operations Basics <operation_basics>` to learn how to add Edge Clusters (i.e., computing nodes) and then finally to :ref:`Usage Basics <usage_basics>` to deploy your VMs, containers or multi-tier services on your new cloud!
