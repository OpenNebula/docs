So we heard you want to try out OpenNebula? Welcome! You came to the right place.

This Quick Start Guide will help you through the process of achieving a fully functional OpenNebula cloud, through a series of tutorials along three sections:

- :ref:`Deployment Basics <deployment_basics>`, where you can deploy an OpenNebula Front-end.
- :ref:`Operation Basics <operation_basics>`, where you can learn to deploy and operate an Edge Cluster.
- :ref:`Usage basics <usage_basics>`, where you can deploy a Virtual Machine and a Kubernetes cluster.

Each section builds on the previous one, to take you from a bare install to quickly deploying an enterprise-grade Kubernetes cluster.

First, to install your Front-end, please select your preferred infrastructure:

- :ref:`Deploy OpenNebula Front-end On-prem <try_opennebula_onprem>`.
- :ref:`Deploy OpenNebula Front-end on AWS <try_opennebula_on_kvm>`.
- :ref:`Deploy OpenNebula Front-end on VMware <try_opennebula_on_vmware>`.
- :ref:`Try OpenNebula Hosted Front-end  <try_opennebula_hosted>`.

Then, you can move on to the next sections to quickly deploy your VMs or multi-tier services on your new cloud.
