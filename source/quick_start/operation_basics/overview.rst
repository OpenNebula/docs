Overview

In this second part of the :ref:`Quick Start Guide <quick_start>`, weâ€™ll focus on deploying an Edge Cluster.

OpenNebula provides the tools to dynamically grow your cloud infrastructure with Edge (lightweight) or HCI (based on Ceph) Clusters built with virtual and physical resources running on remote cloud providers based on the KVM or LXC hypervisors. You can grow your private cloud with resources at cloud and edge data center locations and enable true hybrid and multi-cloud environments to meet latency, bandwidth, or data regulation needs of your workload.

In this section of the Quick Start we use Edge Clusters to easily build a cloud infrastructure and try the main operation and user features of OpenNebula.
