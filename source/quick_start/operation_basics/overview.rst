The aim of this advanced component is to provide the tools and methods needed to dynamically grow your cloud infrastructure with physical resources running on remote bare-metal cloud providers.

The main use case is **Edge Cloud Computing**. This approach will allow the transition from centralized clouds to distributed edge-like cloud environments. You will be able to grow your private cloud with resources at edge data center locations to meet latency, bandwidth or data regulation needs of your workload.

There are several benefits of this approach over the traditional, more decoupled hybrid solution that involves using the provider cloud API. However, one of them stands out among the rest; it is the ability to move offline workloads between your local and rented resources.
