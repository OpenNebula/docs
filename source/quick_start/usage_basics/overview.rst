You made it all the way here, congratulations!

Now it's time to launch some nice services to be hosted by your new OpenNebula cloud. If you followed the Operations Basics guide you most likely now have an LXC virtual Edge Cluster, so you are good to try out :ref:`running containers <running_containers>`.

If you also deploy a KVM metal Edge Cluster (caution, this is pricier) you can also follow the :ref:`running virutal machines <running_virtual_machines>` and :ref:`running Kubernetes clusters <running_containers>` guides.
