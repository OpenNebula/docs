You made it all the way here — congratulations!

Now it’s time to launch some nice services to be hosted by your new OpenNebula cloud. If you followed the :ref:`Operations Basics <operation_basics>` tutorial and deployed a KVM metal Edge Cluster, you can follow the two tutorials in this section:

- :ref:`Running Virtual Machines <running_virtual_machines>`: Download a WordPress VM from the `OpenNebula Public Marketplace <https://marketplace.opennebula.io>`__ and deploy it on the Edge Cluster.
- :ref:`Running Kubernetes Clusters <running_kubernetes_clusters>`: Download an enterprise-grade Kubernetes cluster from the Marketplace, and deploy it on the Edge Cluster.
