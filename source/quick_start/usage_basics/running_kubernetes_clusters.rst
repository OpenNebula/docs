============================
Running Kubernetes Clusters
============================

In previous tutorials of this Quick Start Guide, we:

   * Installed an :ref:`OpenNebula Front-end using miniONE <try_opennebula_on_kvm>`,
   * deployed a :ref:`Metal Edge Cluster <first_edge_cluster>` on AWS, and
   * deployed a :ref:`Virtual Machine <running_virtual_machines>` with WordPress on that Metal Edge Cluster.

At this point, we are ready to deploy something more complex on our Metal Edge Cluster: an enterprise-grade, multi-master Kubernetes cluster based on SUSE Rancher’s RKE2 Kubernetes distribution. Like the WordPress VM, the Kubernetes cluster is available in the `OpenNebula Public Marketplace <https://marketplace.opennebula.io>`. You can find it as the multi-VM appliance **Service OneKE**, the OpenNebula Kubernetes Edition.

To deploy the Kubernetes cluster, we’ll follow these high-level steps:

   #. Download the OneKE Service from the OpenNebula Marketplace.
   #. Instantiate a private network on the Edge Cluster.
   #. Instantiate the Kubernetes Service.
   #. Deploy an application on Kubernetes.

.. important:: As mentioned above, we’ll use the infrastructure created in previous tutorials of this Quick Start Guide, namely our :ref:`OpenNebula Front-end <try_opennebula_on_kvm>` and our :ref:`Metal Edge Cluster <first_edge_cluster>`, both deployed on AWS. To complete this tutorial, you will need the Front-end and the Edge Cluster up and running.

This tutorial includes a preliminary section to avoid known problems related to a datastore parameter in AWS, and a :ref:`Known Issues <k8s_known_issues>` section at the end for troubleshooting.

In this tutorial we’ll perform a basic install of the Kubernetes cluster. The OneKE appliance offers options such as High Availability, Longhorn storage, load balancing and CNI plugins, which are out of the scope of this guide. For the full documentation of the OneKE appliance, please see the `OpenNebula Apps Documentation <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki>`__.

A Preliminary Step: Remove ``REPLICA_HOST``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

It’s a known issue in AWS Edge Clusters that the ``REPLICA_HOST`` parameter in the template for the cluster’s datastore may cause QCOW2 image corruption, which causes VMs to boot incorrectly. To avoid the possibility of sporadic VM boot failures, remove the ``REPLICA_HOST`` parameter from the datastore template.

Follow these steps:

   #. Log in to Sunstone as user ``oneadmin``.
   #. Open the left-hand pane (by hovering your mouse over the icons on the left), then select **Storage** -> **Datastores**.
   
      .. image:: /images/sunstone-storage-datastores.png
         :align: center
         :scale: 50%

   #. Select the **system** datastore for the AWS cluster. (If you began this Quick Start Guide on a clean install, it will probably display ID ``101``.)
   #. Sunstone will display the **Info** panel for the datastore. Scroll down to the **Attributes** section and find the ``REPLICA_HOST`` attribute. Hover your mouse to the right, to display the **Copy**/**Edit**/**Delete** icons |icon3| for the attribute value:
   
      .. image:: /images/sunstone-aws_cluster_replica_host.png
         :align: center
         :scale: 50%
      
      |
   
   #. Click the **Delete** icon |icon4|.

You have deleted the ``REPLICA_HOST`` parameter from the datastore. In the next step we’ll download the OneKE appliance.

..      .. image:: /images/kubernetes-replica_host_param.png   

Step 1. Download the OneKE Service from the OpenNebula Marketplace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The `OpenNebula Public Marketplace <https://marketplace.opennebula.io>`_ is a repository of Virtual Machines and appliances which are curated, tested and certified by OpenNebula.

The Kubernetes cluster is packaged in a multi-VM service appliance listed as **Service OneKE <version>**. To download it, follow the same steps as when downloading the WordPress VM:

Log in to Sunstone as user ``oneadmin``.

Open the left-hand pane, then select **Storage** -> **Apps**. Sunstone will display the **Apps** screen, showing the first page of apps that are available for download.

.. image:: /images/sunstone-apps_list.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%

|

In the search field at the top, type ``oneke`` to filter by name. Then, select **Service OneKE <version number>** with the highest version number, in this case **Service OneKE 1.29** highlighted below.

.. image:: /images/sunstone-service_oneke_1.29.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 60%

|

Click the **Import into Datastore** |icon1| icon.

As with the WordPress appliance, Sunstone displays the **Download App to OpenNebula** wizard. In the first screen of the wizard, click **Next**. In the second screen you will need to select a datastore for the appliance. Select the **aws-edge-cluster-image** datastore.

|kubernetes-qs-marketplace-datastore|

Click **Finish**. Sunstone will display the appliance template and download the appliance in the background. Wait for the appliance **State** to switch from **LOCKED** to **READY**. The appliance comprises a 25GB download, so this may take several minutes.

.. |kubernetes-qs-marketplace-datastore| image:: /images/aws_cluster_images_datastore.png

Step 2. Instantiate a Private Network on the Edge Cluster
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

During :ref:`Provisioning an Edge Cluster <first_edge_cluster>`, OpenNebula automatically created a network template for the Edge Cluster. In this step we will instantiate it and assign a range of IPs to it.

In Sunstone, open the left-hand pane, then select **Network** -> **Network Templates**.

Select the **aws-edge-cluster-private** Virtual Network template, then click the **Instantiate** |icon2| icon at the top.

.. image:: /images/sunstone-aws_cluster_private_net_template.png
   :align: center

|

Sunstone displays the **Instantiate Network Template** wizard. In the first screen, choose a name for the network, e.g. ``aws-private``.

|kubernetes-aws-private-network|

Click **Next**. In the next screen, click the **Address Range** box to select an IP address range for the network.

.. image:: /images/sunstone-aws_cluster_private_net_template-add_addr.png
   :align: center

|

Sunstone displays the **Address Range** dialog box. Here you can define an address range by selecting the first address and the size of the address range. Select a range of private IPv4 addresses, for example ``172.20.0.1``. In this example we’ll set a size of ``100``.

|kubernetes-aws-private-network-range|

Lastly, you will need to add a DNS server for the network. Select the **Context** tab, then the **DNS** input field. Type the address for the DNS server, such as ``8.8.8.8`` or ``1.1.1.1``.

|kubernetes-aws-dns|

Click **Finish**.

At this point, you have instantiated a private network for the Edge Cluster where Kubernetes will be deployed, and are ready to instantiate the Kubernetes Service.

.. |kubernetes-aws-private-network| image:: /images/kubernetes_aws_private_network.png
.. |kubernetes-aws-private-network-range| image:: /images/kubernetes_aws_private_network_address_range.png
.. |kubernetes-aws-dns| image:: /images/kubernetes_aws_dns.png



Step 3. Instantiate the Kubernetes Service
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. Acá iba nota "You may want to adjust the VM templates..." que está en la versión online.

In the left-hand pane, select **Templates** -> **Service Templates**.

Select **Service OneKE 1.29**, then click the **Instantiate** icon |icon2|.

Sunstone displays the **Instantiate Service Template** wizard. In the first screen you can give your service a name and specify the number of instances to instantiate. In this example we’ll use ``OneKE 1.29`` and start a single instance.

|kubernetes-qs-service-start|

Click **Next** to go to the next screen, **User Inputs**.

Here you can define parameters for the cluster, including a custom domain, plugins, VNF routers, storage options and others. There are three User Inputs pages in total; you can browse them by clicking the page numbers at the bottom of each page, highlighted below.

.. image:: /images/sunstone-kubernetes-user_inputs.png
   :align: center
   :scale: 70%

|


Optional: Add a Custom Domain
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To enable access with the ``kubectl`` command from outside the cluster, you can add a custom domain for the Kubernetes SANs. Enter your custom domain in the **ApiServer extra certificate SANs** field, as shown below.

|kubernetes-qs-add-sans|

You can use a public DNS server or add the custom domain to your local ``/etc/hosts`` file, for example:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

   127.0.0.1 localhost
   1.2.3.4 k8s.yourdomain.it
   
.. important::

   When using a custom SAN, to access the cluster using a kubeconfig file you will need to modify the variable ``clusters[0].cluster.server`` in the file to include the name of the cluster, e.g. ``server: https://k8s.yourdomain.it:6443``. The path of the kubeconfig file is set in the ``KUBECONFIG`` variable in the Kubernetes master node.

   To define the variable in the kubeconfig file, follow these high-level steps:

   #. Log in to the Kubernetes master node (see :ref:`Step 4 <step-4>` below).
   #. Find the kubeconfig file by checking the value of the ``KUBECONFIG`` variable, e.g. by running ``echo $KUBECONFIG``.
   #. Edit the file and modify the value of ``clusters[0].cluster.server`` with your domain name, e.g. ``server: https://k8s.yourdomain.it:6443``.

Enable **Traefik/HaProxy**
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To expose an example application on the public network, you will need to enable OneKE’s Traefik solution for ingress traffic. In **User Inputs**, go to Page 2, then click the **Enable Traefik** switch.

|kubernetes-qs-enable-ingress|

Click **Next** to go to the next screen, **Network**.

Select the Public and Private Networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The Kubernetes cluster needs access to the private and the public network defined for the Edge Cluster. First we’ll select the public network. Check that the **Network ID** drop-down menu displays ``Public``, then select the **metal-aws-edge-cluster-public** network.

|kubernetes-qs-pick-networks-public|

To select the private network, change the **Network ID** drop-down to ``Private``, then select **aws-private**.

|kubernetes-qs-pick-networks-private|

Once the public and private networks for the cluster are specified, the Kubernetes service template is ready to be instantiated. Click **Next** to go to the final screen of the wizard.

In the final screen, click **Finish**.

The OpenNebula Front-end will deploy the Kubernetes service to the Edge Cluster. Wait for the cluster **State** to switch to **READY**.

Verify the Cluster Deployment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To verify that the Kubernetes cluster and its VMs have correctly deployed, you can either use the Sunstone UI, or run the ``onevm`` command on the Front-end node.

To verify in the Sunstone GUI, open the left-hand pane, then Select **Instances** -> **Services**. You should see the OneKE service up and running, with its running VMs visible in the **Roles** tab.

To verify the deployment using the command line, log in to the Front-end node as user ``oneadmin``, then run ``oneflow list``. In the command output, check that the State is ``RUNNING``, as shown below.

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

   [oneadmin@FN]$ oneflow list
   ID USER     GROUP    NAME                                 STARTTIME STAT    
   3 oneadmin oneadmin Service OneKE 1.29              04/29 08:18:17 RUNNING

To verify that the VMs for the cluster were correctly deployed, you can use the ``onevm list`` command. In the example below, the command lists the VMs for the cluster (and, in this case, the WordPress VM deployed in the previous tutorial):

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

   [oneadmin@FN]$ onevm list
   ID USER     GROUP    NAME                             STAT  CPU     MEM HOST                              TIME
    5 oneadmin oneadmin storage_0_(service_3)            runn    2      3G <cluster_public_IP>           0d 00h05
    4 oneadmin oneadmin worker_0_(service_3)             runn    2      3G <cluster_public_IP>           0d 00h05
    3 oneadmin oneadmin master_0_(service_3)             runn    2      3G <cluster_public_IP>           0d 00h05
    2 oneadmin oneadmin vnf_0_(service_3)                runn    1      2G <cluster_public_IP>           0d 00h06
    1 oneadmin oneadmin Service WordPress - KVM-1        runn    1      2G 54.235.30.169                 0d 00h21

At this point you have successfully instantiated the Kubernetes cluster. Before deploying an application, you need to find out the **public** IP address of the VNF node, since we will use it later to connect to the master Kubernetes node.

.. _check_vnf:

Check the IP Address for the VNF Node
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To see the IP in Sunstone, go to **Instances** -> **VMs**, then check the **IP** column for the VNF VM.

Alternatively, to check on the command line, log in to the Front-end and run:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

      [oneadmin@FN]$ onevm show -j <VNF_VM_ID>|jq -r .VM.TEMPLATE.NIC[0].EXTERNAL_IP

Replace ``<VNF_VM_ID>`` with the ID of the VNF VM as listed by the ``onevm list`` command (ID ``2`` in the example above).

If you do not see all VMs listed, or if the OneKE Service is stuck in ``DEPLOYING``, see :ref:`Known Issues <k8s_known_issues>` below.

.. tip:: Once the OneFlow service has deployed, you can add more worker nodes. In Sunstone:

      #. Go to **Instances** -> **Services**.
      #. Select the OneKE service.
      #. Select the **Roles** tab.
      #. Click **Worker**, then the green **Scale** button.

.. note:: The VNC icon |icon5| displayed by Sunstone does not work for accessing the VMs on Edge Clusters, since this access method is considered insecure and is disabled by OpenNebula.

.. _step-4:

Step 4. Deploy an Application
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To deploy an application, we will first connect to the master Kubernetes node via SSH.

For connecting to the master Kubernetes node, you need to know the public address (AWS elastic IP) of the VNF node, as described :ref:`above <check_vnf>`.

Once you know the correct IP, from the Front-end node connect to the master Kubernetes node with this command:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ ssh -A -J root@<VNF node public IP> root@172.20.0.2

In this example, ``172.20.0.2`` is the private IP address of the Kubernetes master node (the second address in the private network).

.. tip::

    If you don't use ``ssh-agent`` then you may skip the ``-A`` flag in the above command. You will need to copy your *private* ssh key (used to connect to VNF) into the VNF node itself, at the location ``~/.ssh/id_rsa``. Make sure that the file permissions are correct, i.e. ``0600`` (or ``u=rw,go=``). For example:

    .. prompt:: bash $ auto

        $ ssh root@1.2.3.4 install -m u=rwx,go= -d /root/.ssh/ # make sure ~/.ssh/ exists
        $ scp ~/.ssh/id_rsa root@1.2.3.4:/root/.ssh/           # copy the key
        $ ssh root@1.2.3.4 chmod u=rw,go= /root/.ssh/id_rsa    # make sure the key is secured

Once you have connected to the Kubernetes master node, check if ``kubectl`` is working, by running ``kubectl get nodes``:

.. prompt:: bash root@oneke-ip-172-20-0-2:~#  auto

   root@oneke-ip-172-20-0-2:~# kubectl get nodes
   NAME                  STATUS   ROLES                       AGE   VERSION
   oneke-ip-172-20-0-2   Ready    control-plane,etcd,master   18m   v1.29.4+rke2r1
   oneke-ip-172-20-0-3   Ready    <none>                      16m   v1.29.4+rke2r1

Now we are ready to deploy an application on the cluster. To deploy nginx:

.. prompt:: bash root@oneke-ip-172-20-0-2:~# auto

   root@oneke-ip-172-20-0-2:~# kubectl run nginx --image=nginx --port 80
   pod/nginx created

After a few seconds, you should be able to see the nginx pod running:

.. prompt:: bash root@oneke-ip-172-20-0-2:~# auto

   root@oneke-ip-172-20-0-2:~# kubectl get pods
   NAME    READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
   nginx   1/1     Running   0          86s

In order to access the application, we need to create a Service and IngressRoute objects that expose the application.

Accessing the nginx Application
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On the Kubernetes master node, create a file called ``expose-nginx.yaml`` with the following contents:

.. code-block:: yaml

    ---
    apiVersion: v1
    kind: Service
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    spec:
      selector:
        run: nginx
      ports:
        - name: http
          protocol: TCP
          port: 80
          targetPort: 80
    ---
    apiVersion: traefik.containo.us/v1alpha1
    kind: IngressRoute
    metadata:
      name: nginx
    spec:
      entryPoints: [web]
      routes:
        - kind: Rule
          match: Path(`/`)
          services:
            - kind: Service
              name: nginx
              port: 80
              scheme: http

Apply the manifest using ``kubectl``:

.. prompt:: bash root@oneke-ip-172-20-0-2:~# auto

   root@oneke-ip-172-20-0-2:~# kubectl apply -f expose-nginx.yaml
   service/nginx created
   ingressroute.traefik.containo.us/nginx created

To access the application, point your browser to the public IP of the VNF node in plain HTTP:

|external_ip_nginx_welcome_page|

Congratulations! You have successfully deployed a fully functional Kubernetes cluster at the edge, and have completed the Quick Start Guide.

For more information including additional features for the OneKE Appliance, please refer to the `OpenNebula Apps Documentation <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki>`__.

.. |external_ip_nginx_welcome_page| image:: /images/external_ip_nginx_welcome_page.png

.. _k8s_known_issues:

Known Issues
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
.. _oneflow-service-is-stuck-in-deploying:

OneFlow Service is Stuck in ``DEPLOYING``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

An error in network configuration, or any major failure (such as network timeouts or performance problems) can cause the OneKE service to lock up due to a communications outage between it and the Front-end node. The OneKE service will lock if *any* of the VMs belonging to it does not report ``READY=YES`` to OneGate within the default time.

If one or more of the VMs in the Kubernetes cluster never leave the ``DEPLOYING`` state, you can troubleshoot OneFlow communications by inspecting the file ``/var/log/oneflow.log`` on the Front-end node. Look for a line like the following:

.. code-block:: text

    [E]: [LCM] [one.document.info] User couldn't be authenticated, aborting call.

The line above means that provisioning the service exceeded the allowed time. In this case it is not possible to recover the broken VM instance; it must be recreated.

Before attempting to recreate the instance, ensure that your environment has a good connection to the public Internet and does not suffer from any impairments in performance.

.. _terminate_oneflow:

To recreate the VM instance, you must first terminate the OneKE service. A service stuck in ``DEPLOYING`` cannot be terminated by the ``delete`` operation. To terminate it, you need to run the following command:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

   [oneadmin@FN]$ oneflow recover --delete <service_ID>

Then, re-instantiate the service from the Sunstone UI: in the left-hand pane, **Service Templates** -> **OneKE 1.29**, then click the **Instantiate** icon.

Lack of Connectivity to the OneGate Server
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Another possible cause for VMs in the Kubernetes cluster failing to run is lack of contact between the VNF node in the cluster and the OneGate server on the Front-end.

As described in :ref:`Quick Start Using miniONE on AWS <try_opennebula_on_kvm>`, the AWS instance where the Front-end is running needs to allow incoming connections for port 5030. If you do not want to open the port for all addresses, check the **public** IP address of the VNF node (the AWS Elastic IP, see :ref:`above <check_vnf>`), and create an inbound rule in the AWS security groups that IP.

In cases of lack of connectivity with the OneGate server, the ``/var/log/one/oneflow.log`` file on the Front-end will display messages like the following:


.. code-block:: text

    [EM] Timeout reached for VM [0] to report

In this scenario only the VNF node is successfully deployed, but no Kubernetes nodes.

To troubleshoot, log in to the VNF node via SSH. Then, check if the VNF node is able to contact the OneGate server on the Front-end node, by running this command as root:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

   [root@VNF]$ onegate vm show

A successful response should look like:

.. code-block:: text

    [root@VNF]$ onegate vm show
    VM 0
    NAME            	: vnf_0_(service_3)

And a failure gives a timeout message:

.. code-block:: text

    [root@VNF]$ onegate vm show
    Timeout while connected to server (Failed to open TCP connection to <AWS elastic IP of FN>:5030 (execution expired)).
    Server: <AWS elastic IP of FN>:5030

Possible causes
++++++++++++++++

**Wrong Front-end node AWS IP**: The VNF node may be trying to connect to the OneGate server on the wrong IP address. In the VNF node, the IP address for the Front-end node is defined by the value of ``ONEGATE_ENDPOINT``, in the scripts found in the ``/run/one-context*`` directories. You can check the value with:

.. code-block:: text

    [root@VNF]$ grep ONEGATE -r /run/one-context*

If the value of ``ONEGATE_ENDPOINT`` does not match the IP address where OneGate is listening on the Front-end node, edit the parameter with the correct IP address, then terminate the service from the Front-end (see :ref:`above <terminate_oneflow>`) and re-deploy.

**Filtered incoming connections**: On the Front-end node, the OneGate server listens on port 5030, so you must ensure that this port accepts incoming connections. If necessary, create an inbound rule in the AWS security groups for the elastic IP of the VNF node.
