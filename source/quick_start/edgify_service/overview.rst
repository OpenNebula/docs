So we heard you want to try out OpenNebula? Welcome! You are in the right place.
 
The OpenNebula Edgify Service is aimed at allowing users to evaluate OpenNebula and its functionality to build a distributed multi-cloud and edge environment using resources from cloud providers and on-premise. We will provide you with an OpenNebula front-end, hosted on a virtual machine running on a cloud provider. And it is from there, through the new FireEdge interface and using your own credentials, you will be able to automatically deploy, and correspondingly deactivate, bare-metal edge-clusters.
 
This guide will walk you through the steps to request, setup and manage an OpenNebula Hosted Environment, to provision new resources and to create a production environment for your cloud and edge computing needs.
 
The OpenNebula Hosted PoC allows users to try OpenNebula on KVM for the execution of virtual machines and Kubernetes clusters.
