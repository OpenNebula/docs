Overview
====================

Sharing, provisioning and consuming cloud images is one of the main concerns when using Cloud. OpenNebula provides a simple way to create and integrate with a cloud image provider, called MarketPlaces. Think of them as external datastores.

A MarketPlace can be:

* **Public**: accessible universally by all OpenNebula's.
* **Private**: local within an organization and specific for a single OpenNebula (a single zone) or shared by a federation (a collection of zones).

A MarketPlace is a repository of MarketPlaceApps. A MarketPlaceApp can be thought of as an external Image optionally associated to a Virtual Machine Template.

Using MarketPlaces is very convenient, as it will allow you to move images across different kinds of datastores (using the MarketPlace as an exchange point), it is a way to share OpenNebula images in a Federation, as these resources are federated. In an OpenNebula deployment where the different VDCs don't share any resources, a MarketPlace will act like a shared datastore for all the users.

Supported Actions
=================

MarketPlaces support various actions:

+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Action      | Description                                                         |
+=============+=====================================================================+
| ``create``  | Create a new MarketPlace.                                           |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``monitor`` | This automatic action, discovers the available MarketPlaceApps and  |
|             | monitors the available space of the MarketPlace.                    |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``delete``  | Removes a MarketPlace from OpenNebula. For the Publick MarketPlace, |
|             | it will also remove the MarketPlaceApps, but for any other type of  |
|             | MarketPlace this will not remove the MarketPlaceApps, and will only |
|             | work if the MarketPlace is empty.                                   |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *other*     | Generic actions common to OpenNebula resources are also available:  |
|             | update, chgrp, chown, chmod and rename.                             |
+-------------+---------------------------------------------------------------------+

As for the MarketPlaceApps, they support these actions:

+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Action       | Description                                                        |
+==============+====================================================================+
| ``create``   | Upload a local image into the the MarketPlace. **NOTE:** This      |
|              | action can only be done with marketplaces associated with the      |
|              | current zone.                                                      |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``export``   | Export the MarketPlaceApp and download it into a local Datastore.  |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``delete``   | Removes a MarketPlaceApp.                                          |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``download`` | Downloads a MarketPlaceApp to a file.                              |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| *other*      | Generic actions common to OpenNebula resources are also available: |
|              | update, chgrp, chown, chmod, rename, enable and disable.           |
+--------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

.. warning:: In order to use the ``download`` functionality make sure you read the :ref:`Sunstone Advanced Guide <suns_advance_marketplace>`.

Backends
========

MarketPlaces store the actual MarketPlaceApp images. How they do so depends on the backend driver. Currently these drivers are shipped with OpenNebula:

+---------------------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Driver                    | Upload | Description                                                        |
+===========================+========+====================================================================+
| :ref:`one <market_one>`   | No     | This driver allows read access to the official public `OpenNebula  |
|                           |        | Systems Marketplace <http://marketplace.opennebula.systems>`__, as |
|                           |        | well as to the `OpenNebula AppMarket Add-on                        |
|                           |        | <https://github.com/OpenNebula/addon-appmarket>`__.                |
+---------------------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| :ref:`http <market_http>` | Yes    | When an image is uploaded to a MarketPlace of this kind, the image |
|                           |        | is written into a file in a specified folder, which is in turn     |
|                           |        | available via a web-server.                                        |
+---------------------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+
| :ref:`S3 <market_s3>`     | Yes    | Images are stored into a S3 API-capable service. This means it can |
|                           |        | be stored in the official `AWS S3 service                          |
|                           |        | <https://aws.amazon.com/s3/>`__ , or in services that implement    |
|                           |        | that API like `Ceph Object Gateway S3                              |
|                           |        | <http://docs.ceph.com/docs/master/radosgw/s3/>`__                  |
+---------------------------+--------+--------------------------------------------------------------------+

OpenNebula ships with the OpenNebula Systems MarketPlace pre-registered, so users can access it directly.

Use Cases
=========

Using the MarketPlace is recommended in many scenarios, to name a few:

* When starting with an empty OpenNebula, the public `OpenNebula Systems Marketplace <http://marketplace.opennebula.systems>`__ contains a catalog of :ref:`OpenNebula-ready <context_overview>` cloud images, allowing you to get on your feet very quickly.
* You can upload an image into a MarketPlace, and download it later on to another Datastores even if the source and target Datastores are of a different type, thus enabling image cloning from any datastore to any other datastore.
* In a federation, it is almost essential to have a shared MarketPlace in order to share MarketPlaceApps across zones.
* MarketPlaces are a great way to provide content for the users in VDCs with no initial virtual resources.

How Should I Read This Chapter
