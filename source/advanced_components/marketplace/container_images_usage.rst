Container Image Usage
====================================================

The images from the OpenNebula container marketplaces (:ref:`Docker Hub <market_dh>`, :ref:`Turnkey Linux <market_turnkey_linux>`, and :ref:`Linux Containers <market_linux_container>`) are just filesystem images. When used together with LXD those images are enough for deploying a container, but in order to use any of these images to deploy a Firecracker MicroVM or a KVM VM an uncompressed linux kernel is required.

.. note:: More info on Kernel images can be found :ref:`here <file_ds>`.

Using Container Images with Firecracker
====================================================

In order to deploy a Firecracker MicroVM using one of the images mentioned above, an uncompressed kernel image is required. The Firecracker project provides a recommended `configuration file <https://github.com/firecracker-microvm/firecracker/blob/master/resources/microvm-kernel-x86_64.config>`__ for building the kernel image.

Once the image is in ready state the only think needed to boot the MicroVM is to add the kernel image to the VM template.

Using Container Images with KVM
====================================================

In order to deploy KVM VMs using container images OpenNebula use the PVH entry point which allows to deploy VMs from an uncompressed kernel images with minimal firmware involvement. PVH entry point is a new feature for qemu+kvm which have the following requirements:

- QEMU >= 4.0
- Linux kernel >= 4.21
- `CONFIG_PVH` enabled for the guest kernel.

If the requirements are fulfilled, the only think need to book the container image as a VM is to add the kernel image to the VM template and set the root device (e.g ``vda``).

Getting Kernel Images
====================================================

The kernel images can be either directly build by using the kernel configuration files provided by Firecracker or OpenNebula or can be directly downloaded from OpenNebula marketplace:

- `Firecracker recommended kernel <https://marketplace.opennebula.io/appliance/289ed567-a8b1-4111-aa74-d3b4393f336a>`__

.. note:: The provided kernel images and configuration files have a basic configuration, custom kernel can be built to satisfy different use cases, as long as they fulfill the requirements specified above for the corresponding hypervisor.
