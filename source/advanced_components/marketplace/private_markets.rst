Private MarketPlaces
===============================

Overview
================================================================================

Apart from the available current MarketPlaces supported by OpenNebula, private MarketPlaces are supported in order to allow the cloud administrators to create MarketPlaces to provide their users an easy way of downloading and sharing custom applications.

Backends
================================================================================

Currently two different backends are supported to create private MarketPlaces:

- :ref:`HTTP MarketPlaces <market_http>`
- :ref:`S3 MarketPlaces <market_s3>`
