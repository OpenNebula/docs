Default Infrastructure Provision
================================

In this section you can see how to easily deploy a fully operational cluster with ``oneprovision``. This is a cluster with all the resources needed to deploy a virtual machine,
it includes hosts, datastores and virtual networks. You will also see some examples about how to deploy the virtual machine and ssh to it.

Default Templates
-----------------

OpenNebula provision currently supports two different providers:

- AWS
- Packet

For each of them, you can find an example template, ready to use, provided by OpenNebula. These templates are located in ``/usr/share/one/oneprovision/examples``:

- example_ec2.yaml
- example_packet.yaml

In the following sections you are going to see what changes are needed to deploy these templates and a picture with the resulting infrastructure.

AWS Deployment
--------------

In this example we are going to deploy a cluster with two hosts and the rest of infrastructure resources. Virtual machines deployed in each host will be able to communicate with each other.

Deployment File
###############

The deployment file provided by OpenNebula (``/usr/share/one/oneprovision/examples/example_ec2.yaml``) needs some changes in order to deploy the hosts.

First of all, you need to add your AWS credentials:

- ec2_access
- ec2_secret

In the template you have to change ``******`` by a valid key. You can find `here <https://docs.aws.amazon.com/secretsmanager/latest/userguide/tutorials_basic.html>`__
a guide about how to create those credentials.

Then you need to add the hosts you want to deploy. You have to uncomment the Ubuntu or CentOS hosts, in case of CentOS the final result would be the following:

.. code::

    hosts:
      - reserved_cpu: "100"
        im_mad: "kvm"
        vm_mad: "kvm"
        provision:
          hostname: "centos-host-1"
          ami: "ami-66a7871c"
      - reserved_cpu: "100"
        im_mad: "kvm"
        vm_mad: "kvm"
        provision:
          hostname: "centos-host-2"
          ami: "ami-66a7871c"

After doing this, we have our template ready to be deployed in AWS. You can validate the template using the command ``oneprovision validate``:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ oneprovision validate example_ec2.yaml && echo OK
    OK

Deploy
######

To deploy it you just need to use the command ``oneprovision create example_ec2.yaml``:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ oneprovision create example_ec2.yaml
    ID: ea5a0e54-7b22-4535-9e70-de6bc197f228

.. warning:: This will take a bit, because hosts need to be allocated on AWS/Packet, configured to run hypervisor, and added into OpenNebula.

Infrastructure Validation
#########################

Once the deployment has finished, we can check that all the objects have been correctly created:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ oneprovision host list
  ID NAME               CLUSTER         ALLOCATED_CPU      ALLOCATED_MEM PROVIDER STAT
   5 54.167.216.3       EC2Cluster      0 / -100 (0%)                  - ec2      off
   4 100.24.17.189      EC2Cluster      0 / -100 (0%)                  - ec2      off

    $ oneprovision datastore list
  ID NAME               SIZE AVA CLUSTERS IMAGES TYPE DS      TM      STAT
 111 EC2Cluster-system    0M -   106           0 sys  -       ssh     on
 110 EC2Cluster-image    80G 97% 106           0 img  fs      ssh     on

    $ oneprovision vnet list
  ID USER     GROUP    NAME                             CLUSTERS   BRIDGE   LEASES
  15 oneadmin oneadmin EC2Cluster-private                    106  vxbr100        0
  14 oneadmin oneadmin EC2Cluster-private-host-only-nat      106      br0        0

We can now deploy virtual machines on those hosts. You just need to download and app from the marketplace, store it in the image datastore and instantiate it:

- Export the image from the marketplace

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ onemarketapp export "Alpine Linux 3.11" "Alpine" -d 110
    IMAGE
        ID: 0
    VMTEMPLATE
        ID: 0

- Update the VM template to add the virtual networks

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ ontemplate update 0
    NIC = [
        NETWORK = "EC2Cluster-private",
        NETWORK_UNAME = "oneadmin",
        SECURITY_GROUPS = "0" ]
    NIC = [
        NETWORK = "EC2Cluster-private-host-only-nat",
        NETWORK_UNAME = "oneadmin",
        SECURITY_GROUPS = "0" ]
    NIC_DEFAULT = [
        MODEL = "virtio" ]

- Instantiate the VM template

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    # Instantiate it
    $ onetemplate instantiate 0 -m 2

- Check ping between VMs

    :align: center

Packet Deployment
-----------------

In this example we are going to deploy a cluster with two hosts and the rest of infrastructure resources. Virtual machines deployed in each host will be able to communicate with each other and also we are going to be able to ssh them from outside the host.


.. image:: /images/ddc_packet_deployment.png
    :align: center

Deployment File
###############

The deployment file provided by OpenNebula (``/usr/share/one/oneprovision/examples/example_packet.yaml``) Needs some changes in order to deploy the hosts.

First of all, you need to add your Packet credentials and project ID:

- packet_token
- packet_project

In the template you have to change ``******`` by a valid token. You can create one in your Packer user portal. And to get the project ID just go to project settings tab in Packet.

Then you need to add the hosts you want to deploy. You have to uncomment the Ubuntu or CentOS hosts, in case of CentOS the final result would be the following:

.. code::

    hosts:
      - reserved_cpu: "100"
        im_mad: "kvm"
        vm_mad: "kvm"
        provision:
          hostname: "centos-host"
          os: "centos_7"
      - reserved_cpu: "100"
        im_mad: "kvm"
        vm_mad: "kvm"
        provision:
          hostname: "centos-host"
          os: "centos_7"

After doing this, we have our template ready to be deployed in Packet. You can validate the template using the command ``oneprovision validate``:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ oneprovision validate example_packet.yaml && echo OK
    OK

Deploy
######

To deploy it you just need to use the command ``oneprovision create example_packet.yaml``:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ oneprovision create example_packet.yaml
    ID: fd368975-d438-4588-b311-4c6d51a48679

.. warning:: This will take a bit, because the hosts need to be configured by Ansible.
