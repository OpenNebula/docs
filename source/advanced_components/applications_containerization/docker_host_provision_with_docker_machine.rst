Docker Hosts Provision with Docker Machine
================================================================================

Introduction
================================================================================

The Guides shows how to provision and manage remote Docker Hosts with Docker Machine on your OpenNebula cloud. 

Prerequisites
================================================================================
To follow this guide, you will need the following (see the Platform Notes to see the version certified):

    * Access to a fully working OpenNebula cloud running version 5.6 or later. You can check this by using any OpenNebula CLI command without parameters.
    * A client computer with Docker CLI (the daemon is not required) and Docker Machine installed.
    * Your OpenNebula Cloud must be accessible from your client computer.
    * The OpenNebula Docker application should have been imported into the OpenNebula cloud.

Step 1 - Install Docker Machine OpenNebula Driver
================================================================================

In order to install the Docker Machine OpenNebula Driver just need to install at your fron-end node the package `opennebula-docker`.

If you want to use docker in other host just copy the `docker-machine-driver-opennebula` file from the /usr/share/docker_machine path of your frontend.

Step 2 - Configure Client Machine to Access the OpenNebula Cloud
================================================================================

It is assumed that you have a user with permissions to create / manage instances.

Set up env variables ONE_AUTH to contain user:password and ONE_XMLRPC to point to the OpenNebula cloud:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # export ONE_AUTH=~/.one/one_auth
    # export ONE_XMLRPC=https://<ONE FRONTEND>:2633/RPC2

Step 3 - Use with vCenter
================================================================================

For vCenter hypervisor you will need to follow this steps:
    
    * Make sure you have a network defined in vCenter to connect Docker to.
    * Create a template in vCenter with the desired capacity (CPU, Memory), a new hard disk (select the desired capacity) and new CD/DVD Drive (Datastore    ISO File) with the ISO of the selected OS. Make sure you check Connect At Power On. Do not specify a network.
    * In OpenNebula you will need to import the template and the desired networks. Make sure you make the network type ipv4.

Once you have fulfilled these pre-requisites you can now launch your docker-engine:

    .. prompt:: bash # auto

        # docker-machine create --driver opennebula --opennebula-template-id $TEMPLATE_ID --opennebula-network-id $NETWORK_ID $VM_NAME

Step 4 - Start your First Docker Host
================================================================================

For start your first Docker host you just need to use the `docker-machine create` command:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    #docker-machine create --driver opennebula --opennebula-network-name $NETWORK_NAME --opennebula-image-id $IMG_ID --opennebula-b2d-size $DATA_SIZE_MB $VM_NAME

This command create a VM in OpenNebula using $IMG_ID as image, $NETWORK_NAME as network, $DATA_SIZE_MB as disk size and $VM_NAME as the VM name.

Make sure the network you pass throught $NETWORK_NAME allow Docker Machine to connect to the VM.

You can use many other options for create a VM, like create a VM from a template, you can see all the available options at :ref:`Docker Machine Driver References <docker_machine_driver_reference>` section.

Step 5 - Interact with your Docker Engine
================================================================================

You can list or the VMs deployed by docker machine:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # docker-machine ls
      NAME            ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                        SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
      ubuntu-docker   -        opennebula   Running   tcp://192.168.122.3:2376           v18.04.0-ce   

Poweroff the remote host:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # docker-machine stop ubuntu-docker
      Stopping "ubuntu-docker"...
      Machine "ubuntu-docker" was stopped.
    # docker-machine ls
      NAME            ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL   SWARM   DOCKER   ERRORS
      ubuntu-docker            opennebula   Timeout                          

Restart the remote host:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # docker-machine start ubuntu-docker
      Starting "ubuntu-docker"...
      (ubuntu-docker) Waiting for SSH..
      Machine "ubuntu-docker" was started.
      Waiting for SSH to be available...
      Detecting the provisioner...
    # docker-machine ls 
      NAME            ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                        SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
      ubuntu-docker   -        opennebula   Running   tcp://192.168.122.3:2376           v18.04.0-ce   

Remove the remote host (it will remove the VM from OpenNebula):

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # docker-machine rm ubuntu-docker
      About to remove ubuntu-docker
      WARNING: This action will delete both local reference and remote instance.
      Are you sure? (y/n): y
      Successfully removed ubuntu-docker

Get more information about the host:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # docker-machine inspect ubuntu-docker
      ...
      "EngineOptions": {
            "ArbitraryFlags": [],
            "Dns": null,
            "GraphDir": "",
            "Env": [],
            "Ipv6": false,
            "InsecureRegistry": [],
            "Labels": [],
            "LogLevel": "",
            "StorageDriver": "",
            "SelinuxEnabled": false,
            "TlsVerify": true,
            "RegistryMirror": [],
            "InstallURL": "https://get.docker.com"
        }
      ...

Get the IP address of the host:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # docker-machine ip ubuntu-docker
    192.168.122.3

Connect to the host via SSH:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # docker-machine ssh ubuntu-docker
      $ docker ps -a
        CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                      PORTS               NAMES
        787b15395f48        hello-world         "/hello"            16 seconds ago      Exited (0) 15 seconds ago                       upbeat_bardeen

Activate the host, you can connect your Docker client to the remote host for run docker commands:

.. prompt:: bash # auto
    
    # eval $(docker-machine env ubuntu-docker)
    # docker-machine ls
      NAME            ACTIVE   DRIVER       STATE     URL                        SWARM   DOCKER        ERRORS
      ubuntu-docker   *        opennebula   Running   tcp://192.168.122.3:2376           v18.04.0-ce   
    # docker ps -a
      CONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS                     PORTS               NAMES
      787b15395f48        hello-world         "/hello"            6 minutes ago       Exited (0) 6 minutes ago                       upbeat_bardeen


You can see how an "*" appears at the active field.
