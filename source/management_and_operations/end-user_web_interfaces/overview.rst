Overview
================================================================================

This chapter contains reference guides for Sunstone end-users.

How Should I Read This Chapter
================================================================================

The following sections are intended for the cloud consumers. They can skip most of the OpenNebula documentation and read these two guides only.

Proceed to the corresponding guide following these links:

- :ref:`Self-service Cloud View <cloud_view>`: For cloud consumers that just require a portal where they can provision new virtual machines and services easily.
- :ref:`Group Admin View <group_admin_view>`: For group administrators. This view allows the management of the group's resources, including the creation of new users.

Hypervisor Compatibility
================================================================================

Sunstone is available for all the hypervisors.

.. note::

    When using vCenter, the cloud admin should enable the ``groupadmin_vcenter`` and ``cloud_vcenter`` in ``sunstone-views.yaml``. Read about :ref:`Sunstone views <suns_views>` for more information.
