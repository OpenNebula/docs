Overview
================================================================================

Edge Clusters provide you with the tools needed to dynamically grow your cloud infrastructure with physical or virtual resources running on remote cloud providers. Edge Clusters support two main use cases:

* **Edge Cloud Computing**, to transition from centralized clouds to distributed edge-like cloud environments. You will be able to grow your on-premises cloud with resources at edge data center locations to meet the latency, bandwidth or data regulation needs of your workload.
* **Hybrid Cloud Computing**, to address peaks of demand and need for extra computing power by dynamically growing your underlying physical infrastructure.


How Should I Read This Chapter
==============================

In this chapter you can find a guide on how to automatically allocate and provision Edge Clusters on bare-metal and virtual instances on cloud providers:

  - :ref:`Equinix Edge Clusters <equinix_cluster>`
  - :ref:`Amazon AWS Edge Clusters <aws_cluster>`
  - :ref:`DigitalOcean Edge Cluster <do_cluster>`
  - :ref:`Google Edge Cluster <google_cluster>`
  - :ref:`Vultr Edge Cluster <vultr_virtual_cluster>`
  - :ref:`On-Premise Edge Cluster <onprem_cluster>`

In this chapter you'll also learn how to :ref:`operate your clusters <cluster_operations>` and :ref:`manage providers <provider_operations>`.
