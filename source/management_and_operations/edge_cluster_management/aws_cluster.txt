Edge Cluster Types
================================================================================

There are two kinds of elastic clusters:

* **Metal**: this uses baremetal instances to create OpenNebula Hosts, providing the best performance and highest capacity.
* **Virtual**: this uses a virtual machine instance to create OpenNebula Hosts. This provision is better suited for PaaS like workloads.

You can run the following hypervisors in the clusters:

* **KVM**, runs virtual machines. This hypervisor can be only used with metal clusters.
* **Firecracker**, runs micro VMs. This hypervisor can be only used with metal clusters.
* **LXC**, runs system containers.
