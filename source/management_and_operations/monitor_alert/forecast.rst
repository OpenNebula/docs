Resource Usage Forecast
================================================================================

Overview
================================================================================

The OpenNebula Resource Forecast system provides predictive insights into resource utilization across hosts and virtual machines. By analyzing trends in CPU, memory, network, and disk usage, it allows administrators to proactively manage infrastructure, optimize resource allocation, and prevent performance bottlenecks.

.. note::
   Resource forecasting is automatically enabled upon hypervisor package installation and requires no additional setup. For configuration options, refer to the :ref:`Configuration and Optimization <forecast_configuration>` section.

Key Benefits
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Proactive resource management** – Identify potential constraints before they impact performance.
- **Enhanced capacity planning** – Make data-driven decisions about infrastructure expansion.
- **Optimized workload scheduling** – Improve VM placement based on predictive analysis to minimize resource contention and maintain stability.

When integrated with the :ref:`OpenNebula Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) <scheduler_drs>`, forecasting enables intelligent workload balancing, helping prevent bottlenecks and improve cluster efficiency.

Types of Forecasts
================================================================================

OpenNebula provides two types of resource forecasts:

Long-Term Forecast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Purpose**: Supports capacity planning, hardware provisioning, and resource allocation strategies.

Long-term forecasts are accessible via CLI and Sunstone. The "Monitoring" tab in Sunstone displays predicted trends alongside real-time usage data, aiding administrators in effective planning.

CLI users can retrieve long-term forecasts via:

[INSERT CLI COMMAND EXAMPLE HERE]

By default, long-term forecasts project resource usage for the next 30 days.

Short-Term Forecast
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Purpose**: Facilitates immediate operational decisions and dynamic resource adjustments.

Short-term forecasts power the Predictive DRS, optimizing cluster load distribution. To enable predictive scheduling, refer to :ref:`Distributed Resource Scheduling <scheduler_drs>`.

Sunstone’s "Monitoring" tab also provides short-term forecast data.

CLI users can access short-term forecasts via:

By default, short-term forecasts cover the next 5 minutes.

Forecast Generation
================================================================================

Forecasts rely on OpenNebula’s built-in monitoring system (:ref:`monitor_alert_configuration`). Periodically, monitoring probes analyze real-time CPU, memory, disk, and network metrics to generate predictions. Each host maintains a local time-series database (``/var/tmp/one_db/host.db``) storing historical data for forecasting. Similarly, every VM has a dedicated database (``/var/tmp/one_db/<VM_ID>.db``) that tracks its individual metrics.

.. note::
   When a VM migrates, a new database is created on the destination host, temporarily reducing forecast accuracy until sufficient data accumulates.

The forecast computation process is as follows:

1. Extracts historical data from databases.
2. Identifies trends and patterns through statistical analysis.
3. Applies predictive modeling to estimate future resource consumption.
4. Updates the OpenNebula monitoring system with generated forecasts.
5. Makes predictions available via Sunstone, CLI, and Predictive DRS.

Quality and Accuracy
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The accuracy of the resource forecast generated by the system depends on:

- **Data history** – More historical data improves predictions.
- **Monitoring consistency** – Regular data collection enhances reliability.
- **Workload stability** – Predictable patterns yield better results.
- **Database retention period** – Longer retention helps capture seasonal trends.

Administrators can configure database retention policies to balance storage use and prediction accuracy.

.. warning::
   Outliers in monitoring data can negatively affect forecasts. Investigate unusual VM behavior if predictions become inconsistent.

.. _forecast_configuration:

Configuration and Optimization
================================================================================

The Resource Forecast configuration file is located at ``/var/lib/one/remotes/kvm-probes.d/forecast.conf``.

Default configuration:

.. code:: yaml

    host:
        db_retention: 4  # Weeks
        forecast_period: 5  # Minutes
        forecast_far_period: 720  # Hours (30 days)

    virtualmachine:
        db_retention: 2  # Weeks
        forecast_period: 5  # Minutes
        forecast_far_period: 48  # Hours (2 days)

Administrators can modify retention settings to optimize storage and forecast accuracy.

Storage Considerations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Forecast database size depends on retention and monitoring frequency:

- **Host database**: ~2.5 MB per host (4-week retention, 2-minute intervals)
- **VM database**: ~6.5 MB per VM (2-week retention, 30-second intervals)

To optimize storage:

- Adjust retention based on available capacity.
- Monitor ``/var/tmp/one_db/`` usage.
- Tailor settings to workload cycles (daily, weekly, monthly).

Changes take effect immediately without requiring service restarts.

Usage Tips
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- **Start with defaults** – Default settings suit most environments.
- **Gradually increase retention** – Extend retention if long-term accuracy is needed.
- **Monitor storage usage** – Avoid excessive database growth.
- **Align settings with workload patterns** – Adjust retention for cyclic workloads.
- **Leverage short-term forecasts** for real-time decisions and **long-term forecasts** for planning.
