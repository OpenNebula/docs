Managing Virtual Machines Instances
================================================================================

This guide follows the :ref:`Creating Virtual Machines guide <vm_guide>`. Once a Template is instantiated to a Virtual Machine, there are a number of operations that can be performed using the ``onevm`` command.

Virtual Machine States
================================================================================

The life-cycle of a Virtual Machine within OpenNebula includes the following stages:

.. note:: Note that this is a simplified version. If you are a developer you may want to take a look at the complete diagram referenced in the :ref:`Virtual Machines States Reference guide <vm_states>`):

| Short state |        State         |                                                                                                                                                 Meaning                                                                                                                                                  |
+=============+======================+==========================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================================+
| ``pend``    | ``Pending``          | By default a VM starts in the pending state, waiting for a resource to run on. It will stay in this state until the scheduler decides to deploy it, or the user deploys it using the ``onevm deploy`` command.                                                                                           |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``hold``    | ``Hold``             | The owner has held the VM and it will not be scheduled until it is released. It can be, however, deployed manually.                                                                                                                                                                                      |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``clon``    | ``Cloning``          | The VM is waiting for one or more disk images to finish the initial copy to the repository (image state still in ``lock``)                                                                                                                                                                               |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``prol``    | ``Prolog``           | The system is transferring the VM files (disk images and the recovery file) to the host in which the virtual machine will be running.                                                                                                                                                                    |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``boot``    | ``Boot``             | OpenNebula is waiting for the hypervisor to create the VM.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``runn``    | ``Running``          | The VM is running (note that this stage includes the internal virtualized machine booting and shutting down phases). In this state, the virtualization driver will periodically monitor it.                                                                                                              |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``migr``    | ``Migrate``          | The VM is migrating from one resource to another. This can be a life migration or cold migration (the VM is saved, powered-off or powered-off hard and VM files are transferred to the new resource).                                                                                                    |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``hotp``    | ``Hotplug``          | A disk attach/detach, nic attach/detach operation is in process.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``snap``    | ``Snapshot``         | A system snapshot is being taken.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``save``    | ``Save``             | The system is saving the VM files after a migration, stop or suspend operation.                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``epil``    | ``Epilog``           | In this phase the system cleans up the Host used to virtualize the VM, and additionally disk images to be saved are copied back to the system datastore.                                                                                                                                                 |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``shut``    | ``Shutdown``         | OpenNebula has sent the VM the shutdown ACPI signal, and is waiting for it to complete the shutdown process. If after a timeout period the VM does not disappear, OpenNebula will assume that the guest OS ignored the ACPI signal and the VM state will be changed to **running**, instead of **done**. |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``stop``    | ``Stopped``          | The VM is stopped. VM state has been saved and it has been transferred back along with the disk images to the system datastore.                                                                                                                                                                          |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``susp``    | ``Suspended``        | Same as stopped, but the files are left in the host to later resume the VM there (i.e. there is no need to re-schedule the VM).                                                                                                                                                                          |
+-------------+----------------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``poff``    | ``PowerOff``         | Same as suspended, but no checkpoint file is generated. Note that the files are left in the host to later boot the VM there.                                                                                                                                                                             |

Create and List Virtual Machines
================================================================================

.. note:: Read the :ref:`Creating Virtual Machines guide <vm_guide>` for more information on how to manage and instantiate VM Templates.

.. note:: Read the complete reference for :ref:`Virtual Machine templates <template>`.

Assuming we have a VM Template registered called **vm-example** with ID 6, then we can instantiate the VM issuing a:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onetemplate list
      ID USER     GROUP    NAME                         REGTIME
       6 oneadmin oneadmin vm_example            09/28 06:44:07

    $ onetemplate instantiate vm-example --name my_vm
    VM ID: 0

If the template has :ref:`USER INPUTS <vm_guide_user_inputs>` defined the CLI will prompt the user for these values:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onetemplate instantiate vm-example --name my_vm
    There are some parameters that require user input.
      * (BLOG_TITLE) Blog Title: <my_title>
      * (DB_PASSWORD) Database Password:
    VM ID: 0

Afterwards, the VM can be listed with the ``onevm list`` command. You can also use the ``onevm top`` command to list VMs continuously.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm list
        ID USER     GROUP    NAME         STAT CPU     MEM        HOSTNAME        TIME
         0 oneadmin oneadmin my_vm        pend   0      0K                 00 00:00:03

The scheduler will automatically deploy the VM in one of the hosts with enough resources available. The deployment can also be forced by oneadmin using ``onevm deploy``:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onehost list
      ID NAME               RVM   TCPU   FCPU   ACPU   TMEM   FMEM   AMEM   STAT
       2 testbed              0    800    800    800    16G    16G    16G     on

    $ onevm deploy 0 2

    $ onevm list
        ID USER     GROUP    NAME         STAT CPU     MEM        HOSTNAME        TIME
         0 oneadmin oneadmin my_vm        runn   0      0K         testbed 00 00:02:40

and details about it can be obtained with ``show``:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm show 0
    VIRTUAL MACHINE 0 INFORMATION
    ID                  : 0
    NAME                : my_vm

.. _vm_search:

Searching for VM Instances
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can search for VM instances by using the ``--search`` option of the ``onevm list`` command. This is specially useful on large environments with many VMs. The filter must be in a ``KEY=VALUE`` format and will return all the VMs which fit the filter.

The KEY must be in the VM template section or be one of the following:

    - UNAME
    - GNAME
    - NAME
    - LAST_POLL
    - PREV_STATE
    - PREV_LCM_STATE
    - RESCHED
    - STIME
    - ETIME
    - DEPLOY_ID

For example, for searching a VM with a specific MAC address:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $onevm list --search MAC=02:00:0c:00:4c:dd
     ID    USER     GROUP    NAME    STAT UCPU UMEM HOST TIME
     21005 oneadmin oneadmin test-vm pend    0   0K      1d 23h11

Equivalently if there are more than one VM instance that matches the result they will be shown. For example, VMs with a given NAME:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $onevm list --search NAME=test-vm
     ID    USER     GROUP    NAME    STAT UCPU UMEM HOST TIME
     21005 oneadmin oneadmin test-vm pend    0   0K       1d 23h13
     2100  oneadmin oneadmin test-vm pend    0   0K      12d 17h59

.. warning:: This feature is only available for **MySQL** backend with a version higher or equal than **5.6**.

You can terminate an instance with the ``onevm terminate`` command, from any state. It will shutdown (if needed) and delete the VM. This operation will free the resources (images, networks, etc) used by the VM.

If the instance is running, there is a ``--hard`` option that has the following meaning:

* ``terminate``: Gracefully shuts down and deletes a running VM, sending the ACPI signal. Once the VM is shutdown the host is cleaned, and persistent and deferred-snapshot disk will be moved to the associated datastore. If after a given time the VM is still running (e.g. guest ignoring ACPI signals), OpenNebula will returned the VM to the ``RUNNING`` state.
* ``terminate --hard``: Same as above but the VM is immediately destroyed. Use this action instead of ``terminate`` when the VM doesn't have ACPI support.

Pausing VM Instances
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There are two different ways to temporarily stop the execution of a VM: *short* and *long* term pauses. A **short term** pause keeps all the VM resources allocated to the hosts so its resume its operation in the same hosts quickly. Use the following ``onevm`` commands or Sunstone actions:

* ``suspend``: the VM state is saved in the running Host. When a suspended VM is resumed, it is immediately deployed in the same Host by restoring its saved state.
* ``poweroff``: Gracefully powers off a running VM by sending the ACPI signal. It is similar to suspend but without saving the VM state. When the VM is resumed it will boot immediately in the same Host.
* ``poweroff --hard``: Same as above but the VM is immediately powered off. Use this action when the VM doesn't have ACPI support.

.. note:: When the guest is shutdown from within the VM, OpenNebula will put the VM in the ``poweroff`` state.

You can also plan a **long term pause**. The Host resources used by the VM are freed and the Host is cleaned. VM disk state is saved in the system datastore. The following actions are useful if you want to preserve network and storage allocations (e.g. IPs, persistent disk images):

* ``undeploy``: Gracefully shuts down a running VM, sending the ACPI signal. The Virtual Machine disks are transferred back to the system datastore. When an undeployed VM is resumed, it is be moved to the pending state, and the scheduler will choose where to re-deploy it.
* ``undeploy --hard``: Same as above but the running VM is immediately destroyed.
* ``stop``: Same as ``undeploy`` but also the VM state is saved to later resume it.

When the VM is successfully paused you can resume its execution with:

* ``resume``: Resumes the execution of VMs in the stopped, suspended, undeployed and poweroff states.

Rebooting VM Instances
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the following commands to reboot a VM:

* ``reboot``: Gracefully reboots a running VM, sending the ACPI signal.
* ``reboot --hard``: Performs a 'hard' reboot.

Delaying VM Instances
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The deployment of a PENDING VM (e.g. after creating or resuming it) can be delayed with:

* ``hold``: Sets the VM to hold state. The scheduler will not deploy VMs in the ``hold`` state. Please note that VMs can be created directly on hold, using 'onetemplate instantiate --hold' or 'onevm create --hold'.

Then you can resume it with:

* ``release``: Releases a VM from hold state, setting it to pending. Note that you can automatically release a VM by scheduling the operation as explained below

.. _disk_hotplugging:

Hotplug Devices to a Virtual Machine
================================================================================

.. warning:: Hotplugging might not be available for every supported hypervisor. Please check the limitations of the specific virtualization driver you're using to ensure this feature is available before using it.

Disk Hot-plugging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

New disks can be hot-plugged to running VMs with the ``onevm`` ``disk-attach`` and ``disk-detach`` commands. For example, to attach to a running VM the Image named **storage**:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm disk-attach one-5 --image storage

To detach a disk from a running VM, find the disk ID of the Image you want to detach using the ``onevm show`` command, and then simply execute ``onevm detach vm_id disk_id``:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm show one-5
    ...
    DISK=[
      DISK_ID="1",
    ...
      ]
    ...

    $ onevm disk-detach one-5 1

.. _vm_guide2_nic_hotplugging:

NIC Hot-plugging
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can hot-plug network interfaces to VMs in the ``RUNNING``, ``POWEROFF`` or ``SUSPENDED`` states. Simply specify the network where the new interface should be attached to, for example:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm show 2

    VIRTUAL MACHINE 2 INFORMATION
    ID                  : 2
    NAME                : centos-server
    STATE               : ACTIVE
    LCM_STATE           : RUNNING

    ...

    VM NICS
    ID NETWORK      VLAN BRIDGE   IP              MAC
     0 net_172        no vbr0     172.16.1.201    02:00:ac:10:0

    ...

    $ onevm nic-attach 2 --network net_172

After the operation you should see two NICs, 0 and 1:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm show 2
    VIRTUAL MACHINE 2 INFORMATION
    ID                  : 2
    NAME                : centos-server
    STATE               : ACTIVE
    LCM_STATE           : RUNNING

    ...


    VM NICS
    ID NETWORK      VLAN BRIDGE   IP              MAC
     0 net_172        no vbr0     172.16.1.201    02:00:ac:10:00:c9
                                  fe80::400:acff:fe10:c9
     1 net_172        no vbr0     172.16.1.202    02:00:ac:10:00:ca
                                  fe80::400:acff:fe10:ca
    ...

You can also detach a NIC by its ID. If you want to detach interface 1 (MAC ``02:00:ac:10:00:ca``), execute:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm nic-detach 2 1

.. _vm_guide2_snapshotting:

Virtual Machine System Snapshots
================================================================================

.. warning:: Snapshotting might not be available for every supported hypervisor. Please check the limitations of the specific virtualization driver you're using to ensure this feature is available before using it.


 A system snapshot will contain the current disks and memory state. You can create, delete and restore snapshots for running VMs.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm snapshot-create 4 "just in case"

    $ onevm show 4
    ...
    SNAPSHOTS
      ID         TIME NAME                                           HYPERVISOR_ID
       0  02/21 16:05 just in case                                   onesnap-0

    $ onevm snapshot-revert 4 0 --verbose
    VM 4: snapshot reverted

.. warning:: Snapshots for VMs running under the **KVM hypervisor** presents consideration the following limitations:

    -  The snapshots are lost if any life-cycle operation is performed, e.g. a suspend, migrate, delete request.
    -  Snapshots are only available if all the VM disks use the :ref:`qcow2 driver <img_template>`.

.. _vm_guide_2_disk_snapshots:

Virtual Machine Disk Snapshots
================================================================================

There are two kinds of operations related to disk snapshots:

* ``disk-snapshot-create``, ``disk-snapshot-revert``, ``disk-snapshot-delete``, ``disk-snapshot-rename``: Allows the user to take snapshots of the disk states and return to them during the VM life-cycle. It is also possible to rename or delete snapshots.
* ``disk-saveas``: Exports VM disk (or a previously created snapshot) to an Image in an OpenNebula Datastore. This is a live action.

.. warning:: Disk snapshost might have different limitations depending on the hypervisor. Please check the limitations of the specific virtualization driver you're using to ensure this feature is available before using it.

.. _vm_guide_2_disk_snapshots_managing:

Managing Disk Snapshots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

A user can take snapshots of VM disks to create a checkpoint of the state of an specific disk at any time. These snapshots can be organized, depending on the storage backend:

- In a tree-like structure, meaning that every snapshot has a parent, except for the first snapshot whose parent is ``-1``. The active snapshot, the one the user has last reverted to, or taken, will act as the parent of the next snapshot. It's possible to delete snapshots that are not active and that have no children.
- Flat structure, without parent/child relationship. In that case, snapshots can be freely removed.

Disk snapshots are managed with the following commands:

- ``disk-snapshot-create <vmid> <diskid> <name>``: Creates a new snapshot of the specified disk.
- ``disk-snapshot-revert <vmid> <diskid> <snapshot_id>``: Reverts to the specified snapshot. The snapshots are immutable, therefore the user can revert to the same snapshot as many times as he wants, the disk will return always to the state of the snapshot at the time it was taken.
- ``disk-snapshot-delete <vmid> <diskid> <snapshot_id>``: Deletes a snapshot if it has no children and is not active.

``disk-snapshot-create`` can take place when the VM is in ``RUNNING`` state, provided that the drivers support it, while ``disk-snapshot-revert`` requires the VM to be ``POWEROFF`` or ``SUSPENDED``. Live snapshots are only supported for some hypervisors and storage drivers:

- Hypervisor ``VM_MAD=kvm`` combined with ``TM_MAD=qcow2`` datastores. In this case OpenNebula will request that the hypervisor executes ``virsh snapshot-create``.
- Hypervisor ``VM_MAD=kvm`` with Ceph datastores (``TM_MAD=ceph``). In this case OpenNebula will initially create the snapshots as Ceph snapshots in the current volume.

With these combinations (CEPH and qcow2 datastores and KVM hypervisor) you can :ref:`enable QEMU Guest Agent <enabling_qemu_guest_agent>`. With this agent enabled the filesystem will be frozen while the snapshot is being done.

.. warning:: OpenNebula will not automatically handle live ``disk-snapshot-create`` and ``disk-snapshot-revert`` operations for VMs in ``RUNNING`` if the virtualization driver do not support it (check the limitations of the corresponding virtualization driver guide to know if this feature is available for your hypervisor). In this case the user needs to suspend or poweroff the VM before creating the snapshot.

See the :ref:`Storage Driver <sd_tm>` guide for a reference on the driver actions invoked to perform live and non-live snapshost.

.. warning::

  Depending on the ``DISK/CACHE`` attribute the live snapshot may or may not work correctly. To be sure, you can use ``CACHE=writethrough``, although this delivers the slowest performance.

Persistent Images and Disk Snapshots
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

These actions are available for both persistent and non-persistent images. In the case of persistent images the snapshots **will** be preserved upon VM termination and will be able to be used by other VMs using that image. See the :ref:`snapshots <images_snapshots>` section in the Images guide for more information.


.. _disk_save_as_action:

Saving a VM Disk to an Image (``disk-saveas``)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Any VM disk can be saved to a new image (if the VM is in ``RUNNING``, ``POWEROFF``, ``SUSPENDED``, ``UNDEPLOYED`` or ``STOPPED`` states). This is a live operation that happens immediately. This operation accepts ``--snapshot <snapshot_id>`` as an optional argument, which specifies a disk snapshot to use as base of the new Image, instead of the current disk state (value by default).

.. warning::

  This action is not in sync with the hypervisor. If the VM is in ``RUNNING`` state make sure the disk is unmounted (preferred), synced or quiesced in some way or another before doing the ``disk-saveas`` operation.

.. _vm_guide2_resizing_a_vm:

Resizing VM Resources
================================================================================

You may resize the capacity assigned to a Virtual Machine in terms of the virtual CPUs, memory and CPU allocated. VM resizing can be done in any of the following states:
POWEROFF, UNDEPLOYED and with some limitations also live in RUNNING state.

If you have created a Virtual Machine and you need more resources, the following procedure is recommended:

-  Perform any operation needed to prepare your Virtual Machine for shutting down, e.g. you may want to manually stop some services
-  Poweroff the Virtual Machine
-  Resize the VM
-  Resume the Virtual Machine using the new capacity

Note that using this procedure the VM will preserve any resource assigned by OpenNebula, such as IP leases.

The following is an example of the previous procedure from the command line:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm poweroff web_vm
    $ onevm resize web_vm --memory 2G --vcpu 2
    $ onevm resume web_vm

Live Resize of Capacity
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to resize the capacity in the RUNNING state you have to setup some extra attributes to VM template, this attributes **must be set before the VM is started**. These attributes are driver specific, more info for :ref:`KVM <kvm_live_resize>` and :ref:`vCenter <vcenter_live_resize>`.

.. warning:: Hotplug is only implemented only for KVM and vCenter.

.. _vm_guide2_resize_disk:

Resizing VM Disks
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If the disks assigned to a Virtual Machine need more size, this can achieved at instantiation time of the VM. The SIZE parameter of the disk can be adjusted and, if it is bigger than the original size of the image, OpenNebula will:

- Increase the size of the disk container prior to launching the VM
- Using the :ref:`contextualization packages <context_overview>`, at boot time the VM will grow the filesystem to adjust to the new size.

You can override the size of a ``DISK`` in a VM Template at instantiation:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onetemplate instantiate <template> --disk u2104:size=20000 # Image u2104 will be resized to 2 GB


This can also be achieved from Sunstone, both in Cloud and Admin View, at the time of instantiating a VM Template.

.. important:: In vCenter a disk can be resized only if the VM is in poweroff state and the VM has no snapshots or the vCenter template, which the VM is based on, doesn't use linked clones.

.. _vm_updateconf:

Updating the Virtual Machine Configuration
================================================================================

Some of the VM configuration attributes defined in the VM Template can be updated after the VM is created. The ``onevm updateconf`` command will allow you to change the following attributes:

+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|  Attribute   |                              Sub-attributes                             |
+==============+=========================================================================+
| ``OS``       | ``ARCH``, ``MACHINE``, ``KERNEL``, ``INITRD``, ``BOOTLOADER``, ``BOOT``,|
|              | ``SD_DISK_BUS``, ``UUID``                                               |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``FEATURES`` | ``ACPI``, ``PAE``, ``APIC``, ``LOCALTIME``, ``HYPERV``, ``GUEST_AGENT``,|
|              | ``IOTHREADS``                                                           |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``INPUT``    | ``TYPE``, ``BUS``                                                       |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``GRAPHICS`` | ``TYPE``, ``LISTEN``, ``PASSWD``, ``KEYMAP``                            |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``RAW``      | ``DATA``, ``DATA_VMX``, ``TYPE``                                        |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``CONTEXT``  | Any value. **Variable substitution will be made**                       |
+--------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Visit the :ref:`Virtual Machine Template reference <template>` for a complete description of each attribute.

.. warning:: This action might not be supported for ``RUNNING`` VMs depending on the hypervisor. Please check the limitation section of the specific virtualization driver.

.. note:: In running state only changes in CONTEXT take effect immediately, other values may need a VM restart. Also, the action may fail and the context will not be changed if the VM is running. You can try to manualy trigger the action again.

.. _vm_guide2_clone_vm:

Cloning a Virtual Machine
================================================================================

A VM Template or VM instance can be copied to a new VM Template. This copy will preserve the changes made to the VM disks after the instance is terminated. The template is private, and will only be listed to the owner user.

There are two ways to create a persistent private copy of a VM:

- Instantiate a VM Template with the *to persistent* option.
- Save a existing VM instance with ``onevm save``

Instantiate to persistent
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

When **instantiating to persistent** the Template is cloned recursively (a private persistent clone of each disk Image is created), and that new Template is instantiated.

To "instantiate to persistent" use the ``--persistent`` option:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onetemplate instantiate web_vm --persistent --name my_vm
    VM ID: 31

    $ onetemplate list
      ID USER            GROUP           NAME                                REGTIME
       7 oneadmin        oneadmin        web_vm                       05/12 14:53:11
       8 oneadmin        oneadmin        my_vm                        05/12 14:53:38

    $ oneimage list
      ID USER       GROUP      NAME            DATASTORE     SIZE TYPE PER STAT RVMS
       7 oneadmin   oneadmin   web-img         default       200M OS   Yes used    1
       8 oneadmin   oneadmin   my_vm-disk-0    default       200M OS   Yes used    1

Equivalently, in Sunstone activate the "Persistent" switch next to the create button.

Please bear in mind the following ``ontemplate instantiate --persistent`` limitation: Volatile disks cannot be persistent. The contents of the disks will be lost when the VM is terminated. The cloned VM Template will contain the definition for an empty volatile disk.

Save a VM Instance
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Alternatively, a VM that was not created as persistent can be **saved** before it is destroyed. To do so, the user has to ``poweroff`` the VM first and then use the ``save`` operation.

This action clones the VM source Template, replacing the disks with copies of the current disks (see the disk-snapshot action). If the VM instance was resized, the current capacity is also used. The new cloned Images can be made persistent with the ``--persistent`` option. NIC interfaces are also overwritten with the ones from the VM instance, to preserve any attach/detach action.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm save web_vm copy_of_web_vm --persistent
    Template ID: 26

Please bear in mind the following ``onevm save`` limitations:

- The VM's source Template will be used. If this Template was updated since the VM was instantiated, the new contents will be used.
- Volatile disks cannot be saved, and the current contents will be lost. The cloned VM Template will contain the definition for an empty volatile disk.
- Disks and NICs will only contain the target Image/Network NAME and UNAME if defined. If your Template requires extra configuration, you will need to update the new Template.

.. _vm_guide2_scheduling_actions:

Scheduled Actions for Virtual Machines
================================================================================

Scheduled actions lets you program operations over a VM to be performed in the future, e.g. *Shutdown the VM after 5 hours*. OpenNebula supports two types of schedule actions:

- punctual, that can be also periodic.
- relative actions.

One-Time Punctual Actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Most of the onevm commands accept the ``--schedule`` option, allowing users to delay the actions until the given date and time.

Here is an usage example:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm suspend 0 --schedule "09/20"
    VM 0: suspend scheduled at 2016-09-20 00:00:00 +0200

    $ onevm resume 0 --schedule "09/23 14:15"
    VM 0: resume scheduled at 2016-09-23 14:15:00 +0200

    $ onevm show 0
    VIRTUAL MACHINE 0 INFORMATION
    ID                  : 0
    NAME                : one-0

    [...]

    SCHEDULED ACTIONS
    ID ACTION             SCHEDULED                  REP                  END         DONE MESSAGE
     0 suspend     09/20 00:00            																							 -
     1 resume      09/23 14:15            																							 -

These actions can be deleted or edited using the ``onevm update`` command. The time attributes use Unix time internally.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm update 0

    SCHED_ACTION=[
      ACTION="suspend",
      ID="0",
      TIME="1379628000" ]
    SCHED_ACTION=[
      ACTION="resume",
      ID="1",
      TIME="1379938500" ]

Periodic Punctual Actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To schedule periodic actions also use the option --schedule. However this command also needs more options to define the periodicity of the action:

    - ``--weekly``: defines a weekly periodicity, so, the action will be execute all weeks, the days that the user defines.
    - ``--monthly``: defines a monthly periodicity, so, the action will be execute all months, the days that the user defines.
    - ``--yearly``: defines a yearly periodicity, so, the action will be execute all year, the days that the user defines.
    - ``--hourly``: defines a hourly periodicity, so, the action will be execute each 'x' hours.
    - ``--end``: defines when you want that the relative action finishes.

The option ``--weekly``, ``--monthly`` and ``--yearly`` need the number of the days that the users wants execute the action.

    - ``--weekly``: days separate with commas between 0 and 6. [0,6]
    - ``--monthly``: days separate with commas between 1 and 31. [0,31]
    - ``--weekly``: days separate with commas between 0 and 365. [0,365]

The option ``--hourly`` needs a number with the number of hours. [0,168] (1 week)

The option ``--end`` can be a number or a date:

    - Number: defines the number of repetitions.
    - Date: defines the date that the user wants to finished the action.

Here is an usage example:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm suspend 0 --schedule "09/20" --weekly "1,5" --end 5
    VM 0: suspend scheduled at 2018-09-20 00:00:00 +0200

    $ onevm resume 0 --schedule "09/23 14:15" --weekly "2,6" --end 5
    VM 0: resume scheduled at 2018-09-23 14:15:00 +0200

    $ onevm snapshot-create 0 --schedule "09/23" --hourly 5 --end "12/25"
    VM 0: resume scheduled at 2018-09-23 14:15:00 +0200

    $ onevm show 0
    VIRTUAL MACHINE 0 INFORMATION
    ID                  : 0
    NAME                : one-0

    [...]

    SCHEDULED ACTIONS
    ID ACTION            SCHEDULED                  REP                  END         DONE MESSAGE
    0 suspend          09/23 00:00           Weekly 1,5        After 5 times            -
    1 resume           09/23 00:00           Weekly 2,6        After 5 times            -
    2 snapshot-create  09/23 00:00         Each 5 hours          On 12/25/18            -

These actions can be deleted or edited using the ``onevm update`` command. The time attributes use Unix time internally.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm update 0

    SCHED_ACTION=[
        ACTION="suspend",
        DAYS="1,5",
        END_TYPE="1",
        END_VALUE="5",
        ID="0",
        REPEAT="0",
        TIME="1537653600" ]
    SCHED_ACTION=[
        ACTION="resume",
        DAYS="2,6",
        END_TYPE="1",
        END_VALUE="5",
        ID="1",
        REPEAT="0",
        TIME="1537653600" ]
    SCHED_ACTION=[
        ACTION="snapshot-create",
        DAYS="5",
        END_TYPE="2",
        END_VALUE="1545692400",
        ID="2",
        REPEAT="3",
        TIME="1537653600" ]


Relative Actions
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Scheduled actions can be also relative to the Start Time of the VM. That is, it can be set on a VM Template, and apply to the number of seconds after the VM is instantiated.

For instance, a VM Template with the following SCHED_ACTION will spawn VMs that will automatically shutdown after 1 hour of being instantiated.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onetemplate update 0

    SCHED_ACTION=[
       ACTION="terminate",
       ID="0",
       TIME="+3600" ]


This functionality is present graphically in Sunstone in the VM Template creation and update dialog, and in the VM Actions tab.

.. _schedule_actions:

The following table summarizes the actions that can be scheduled. Note that some of the above actions need some parameters to run (e.g. a disk ID or a snapshot name).

+--------------------------+------------------+

+--------------------------+------------------+
| ``disk-snapshot-revert`` | disk ID, snap ID |
+--------------------------+------------------+

+--------------------------+------------------+

You can pass arguments to the scheduled actions using the parameter ``ARGS`` in the action definition. For example:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm update 0

    SCHED_ACTION=[
        ACTION="disk-snapshot-create",
        ARGS="0, disksnap_example",
        DAYS="1,5",
        END_TYPE="1",
        END_VALUE="5",
        ID="0",
        REPEAT="0",
        TIME="1537653600" ]

In this example, the first argument would be the disk and the second the snapshot name.

.. note:: The arguments are mandatory. If you use the CLI or Sunstone they are generated automatically for the actions.

.. _vm_charter:

Virtual Machine Charters
================================================================================

This functionality automatically adds scheduling actions in VM templates. To enable Charters, you only need add the following to ``sunstone-server.conf`` file:

|image1|

.. prompt:: text $ auto

  :leases:
    suspend:
      time: "+1209600"
      color: "#000000"
      warning:
        time: "-86400"
        color: "#085aef"
    terminate:
      time: "+1209600"
      color: "#e1ef08"
      warning:
        time: "-86400"
        color: "#ef2808"

In the previous example you can see that Scheduled Actions are added to the VMs. You can tune the following values:

+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| time    | Time for the action in secs example: +1209600 is to weeks.                                            |
|         | The order is very important since time adds to the previous scheduled action.                         |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| color   | Is the color in hexadecimal since the icon will appear in the Vms table                               |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| warning | It is an alert (color change of the icon in the VM table) that will change when the limit has elapsed |
|         | minus the time placed                                                                                 |
+---------+-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

This functionality is also available in the CLI, through the following commands:

- onevm create-chart
- onevm update-chart
- onevm delete-chart

The charters can be added into the ``onevm`` configuration file ``/etc/one/cli/onevm.yaml``:

.. code::

    :charters:
      :suspend:
        :time: "+1209600"
        :warning:
          :time: 86400
      :terminate:
        :time: "+1209600"
        :warning:
          :time: 86400

The information about the charters can be checked with the command ``onevm show``:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    SCHEDULED ACTIONS
    ID    ACTION  ARGS   SCHEDULED REPEAT   END  DONE                             MESSAGE CHARTER
     1 terminate     - 01/01 03:00                  -                                   - In 1.25 hours *

.. warning:: If the CHARTER has a * it shows the warning message as it was configured previously.

.. _vm_guide2_user_defined_data:

User Defined Data
================================================================================

Custom attributes can be added to a VM to store metadata related to this specific VM instance. To add custom attributes simply use the ``onevm update`` command.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm show 0
    ...

    VIRTUAL MACHINE TEMPLATE
    ...
    VMID="0"

    $ onevm update 0
    ROOT_GENERATED_PASSWORD="1234"
    ~
    ~

    $onevm show 0
    ...

    VIRTUAL MACHINE TEMPLATE
    ...
    VMID="0"

    USER TEMPLATE
    ROOT_GENERATED_PASSWORD="1234"

Virtual Machine Monitoring
================================================================================

The monitoring probes gathers information attributes and insert them in the VM template. This information is mainly used for:

  * Monitor the status of the VM.
  * Gather the resource usage data of the VM.

In general, you can find the following monitoring information for a VM, note that each hypervisor may include additional attributes:

+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| Key           | Description                                                                                  |
+===============+==============================================================================================+
| ID            | ID of the VM in OpenNebula.                                                                  |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| UUID          | Unique ID, must be unique across all hosts.                                                  |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| MONITOR       | Base64 encoded monitoring information, the monitoring information includes following data:   |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| TIMESTAMP     | Timestamp of the measurement.                                                                |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| CPU           | Percentage of 1 CPU consumed (two fully consumed cpu is 2.0).                                |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| MEMORY        | MEMORY consumption in kilobytes.                                                             |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DISKRDBYTES   | Amount of bytes read from disk.                                                              |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DISKRDIOPS    | Number of IO read operations.                                                                |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DISKWRBYTES   | Amount of bytes written to disk.                                                             |
+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| DISKWRIOPS    | Number of IO write operations.                                                               |

+---------------+----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Virtual Machine VM Permissions
================================================================================

OpenNebula comes with an advanced :ref:`ACL rules permission mechanism <manage_acl>` intended for administrators, but each VM object has also :ref:`implicit permissions <chmod>` that can be managed by the VM owner. To share a VM instance with other users or to allow them to list and show its information, use the ``onevm chmod`` command:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm show 0
    ...
    PERMISSIONS
    OWNER          : um-
    GROUP          : ---
    OTHER          : ---

    $ onevm chmod 0 640

    $ onevm show 0
    ...
    PERMISSIONS
    OWNER          : um-
    GROUP          : u--
    OTHER          : ---

Administrators can also change the VM's group and owner with the ``chgrp`` and ``chown`` commands.

.. _life_cycle_ops_for_admins:

Advanced Operations for Administrators
================================================================================

There are some ``onevm`` commands operations meant for the cloud administrators:

**Scheduling:**

-  ``resched``: Sets the reschedule flag for the VM. The Scheduler will migrate (or migrate --live, depending on the :ref:`Scheduler configuration <schg_configuration>`) the VM in the next monitorization cycle to a Host that better matches the requirements and rank restrictions. Read more in the :ref:`Scheduler documentation <schg_re-scheduling_virtual_machines>`.
-  ``unresched``: Clears the reschedule flag for the VM, canceling the rescheduling operation.

**Deployment:**

-  ``deploy``: Starts an existing VM in a specific Host.
-  ``migrate --live``: The Virtual Machine is transferred between Hosts with no noticeable downtime. This action requires a :ref:`shared file system storage <sm>`.
-  ``migrate``: The VM gets stopped and resumed in the target host. In an infrastructure with :ref:`multiple system datastores <sched_ds>`, the VM storage can be also migrated (the datastore id can be specified).

Note: By default, the above operations do not check the target host capacity. You can use the ``--enforce`` option to be sure that the host capacity is not overcommitted.

**Troubleshooting:**

-  ``recover``: If the VM is stuck in any other state (or the boot operation does not work), you can recover the VM with the following options. Read the :ref:`Virtual Machine Failures guide <ftguide_virtual_machine_failures>` for more information.

   - ``--success``: simulates the success of the missing driver action
   - ``--failure``: simulates the failure of the missing driver action
   - ``--retry``: retries to perform the current driver action. Optionally the ``--interactive`` can be combined if its a Transfer Manager problem.
   - ``--delete``: Deletes the VM, moving it to the DONE state immediately
   - ``--recreate``: Deletes the VM, and moves it to the PENDING state

-  ``migrate`` or ``resched``: A VM in the UNKNOWN state can be booted in a different host manually (``migrate``) or automatically by the scheduler (``resched``). This action must be performed only if the storage is shared, or manually transfered by the administrator. OpenNebula will not perform any action on the storage for this migration.

.. _remote_access_sunstone:

Accessing VM Console and Desktop
================================================================================

.. TODO - Needs review and rewrite

Sunstone provides several different methods to access your VM console and desktop: VNC, SPICE, RDP, VMRC, SSH, and ``virt-viewer``. If configured in the VM, these methods can be used to access the VM console through Sunstone.  For some of those connections, we will need to start a new FireEdge server to establish the remote connection. This section shows how these different technologies can be configured and what each requirement is.

:ref:`FireEdge <fireedge_configuration>` automatically installs dependencies for Guacamole connectinos and VMRC proxy, which are necessary to use VNC, RDP, SSH, and VMRC.

+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+
|   Connection    |   With FireEdge   |  Without FireEdge   |
+=================+===================+=====================+
| VNC             | Guacamole         | noVNC               |
+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| RDP             | Guacamole         | noVNC               |
+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| SSH             | Guacamole         | N/A                 |
+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| SPICE           | noVNC             | noVNC               |
+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| ``virt-viewer`` | noVNC             | noVNC               |
+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+
| VMRC            | VMRC proxy        | N/A                 |
+-----------------+-------------------+---------------------+

.. important::

    :ref:`FireEdge <fireedge_conf>` server must be running to get Guacamole connections working. For VMRC, Sunstone and FireEdge must be running on the **same server**.

.. _requirements_remote_access_sunstone:

Requirements for connections via noVNC
--------------------------------------

The Sunstone GUI offers the possibility of starting a VNC/SPICE session to a Virtual
Machine. This is done by using a **VNC/SPICE websocket-based client (noVNC)** on the client side and
a VNC proxy translating and redirecting the connections on the server side.

To enable VNC/SPICE console service, you must have a ``GRAPHICS`` section in the VM template, as
stated in the documentation. Make sure the attribute ``IP`` is set correctly (``0.0.0.0`` to allow
connections from everywhere), otherwise no connections will be allowed from the outside.

For example, to configure this in the Virtual Machine template:

.. code-block:: none

    GRAPHICS=[
        LISTEN="0.0.0.0",
        TYPE="vnc"
    ]

Make sure there are no firewalls blocking the connections and websockets enabled in your browser.
**The proxy will redirect the websocket** data from the VNC proxy port to the VNC port stated in
the template of the VM. The value of the proxy port is defined in ``sunstone-server.conf`` as
``:vnc_proxy_port``.

You can retrieve useful information from ``/var/log/one/novnc.log``. **Your browser must support
websockets**, and have them enabled.

When using secure websockets, make sure that your certificate and key (if not included in the
certificate) are correctly set in the :ref:`Sunstone configuration files <sunstone_setup>`.
Note that your certificate must be valid and trusted for the wss connection to work.

If you are working with a certificate that is not accepted by the browser, you can manually add
it to the browser trust list by visiting ``https://sunstone.server.address:vnc_proxy_port``.
The browser will warn that the certificate is not secure and prompt you to manually trust it.

.. _vnc_sunstone:

Configuring your VM for VNC
---------------------------

VNC is a graphical console with wide support among many hypervisors and clients.

VNC without FireEdge
""""""""""""""""""""

When clicking the VNC icon a request is made, and if a VNC session is possible, the Sunstone server will add the VM
Host to the list of allowed vnc session targets and create a **random token** associated with it. The
server responds with the session token, then a ``noVNC`` dialog pops up.

The VNC console embedded in this dialog will try to connect to the proxy, either using websockets
(default) or emulating them using Flash. Only connections providing the right token will be successful.
The token expires and cannot be reused.

Make sure that you can connect directly from the Sunstone Front-end to the VM using a normal VNC
client tool, such as ``vncviewer``.

.. _requirements_guacamole_vnc_sunstone:

VNC with FireEdge
"""""""""""""""""

To enable the VNC console service you must have a ``GRAPHICS`` section in the VM template,
as stated in the documentation.

To configure it via Sunstone, you need to update the VM template. In the Input/Output tab,
you can see the graphics section where you can add the IP, the port, a connection password
or define your keymap.

|sunstone_guac_vnc|

To configure this in Virtual Machine template in **advanced mode**:

.. code-block:: none

    GRAPHICS=[
        LISTEN="0.0.0.0",
        TYPE="vnc"
    ]

.. note:: Make sure the attribute ``IP`` is set correctly (``0.0.0.0`` to allow connections
    from everywhere), otherwise, no connections will be allowed from the outside.

.. _rdp_sunstone:

Configure VM for RDP
--------------------

Short for **Remote Desktop Protocol**, it allows one computer to connect to another computer
over a network in order to use it remotely.

RDP without FireEdge
""""""""""""""""""""

RDP connections are available on Sunstone using noVNC. You will only have to download the
RDP file and open it with an RDP client to establish a connection with your Virtual Machine.

.. _requirements_guacamole_rdp_sunstone:

RDP with FireEdge
"""""""""""""""""

To enable RDP connections to the VM, you must have one ``NIC``
with ``RDP`` attribute equal to ``YES`` in the template.

Via Sunstone, you need to enable a RDP connection on one of the VM template networks, **after or
before its instantiation**.

|sunstone_guac_nic|

To configure this in Virtual Machine template in **advanced mode**:

.. code-block:: none

    NIC=[
        ...
        RDP = "YES"
    ]

Once the VM is instantiated, users will be able to download the **file configuration or
connect via browser**.

|sunstone_guac_rdp|

.. important:: **The RDP connection is only allowed to activate on a single NIC**. In any
    case, the connection will only contain the IP of the first NIC with this property enabled.
    The RDP connection will work the **same way for NIC ALIASES**.

.. note:: If the VM template has a ``PASSWORD`` and ``USERNAME`` set in the contextualization
    section, this will be reflected in the RDP connection. You can read about them in the
    :ref:`Virtual Machine Definition File reference section <template_context>`.

.. _requirements_guacamole_ssh_sunstone:

Configure VM for SSH
--------------------

**SSH connections are available only when a reachable Firedge server is found**. Unlike VNC or RDP,
SSH is a text protocol. SSH connections require a hostname or IP address defining
the destination machine. Like with the :ref:`RDP <requirements_guacamole_rdp_sunstone>` connections,
you need to enable the SSH connection on one of the VM template networks.

For example, to configure this in the Virtual Machine template in **advanced mode**:

.. code-block:: none

    NIC=[
        ...
        SSH = "YES"
    ]

SSH is standardized to use port 22 and this will be the proper value in most cases. You only
need to specify the **SSH port in the contextualization section as** ``SSH_PORT`` if you are
not using the standard port.

.. note:: If the VM template has a ``PASSWORD`` and ``USERNAME`` set in the contextualization
	section, this will be reflected in the SSH connection. You can read about them in the
	:ref:`Virtual Machine Definition File reference section <template_context>`.

For example, to allow connection by username and password to a guest VM, first make sure you
have SSH root access to the VM, check more info :ref:`here <cloudview_ssh_keys>`.

After that you can access the VM and configure the SSH service:

.. code-block:: bash

    oneadmin@frontend:~$ ssh root@<guest-vm>

    # Allow authentication with password: PasswordAuthentication yes
    root@<guest-VM>:~$ vi /etc/ssh/sshd_config

    # Restart SSH service
    root@<guest-VM>:~$ service sshd restart

    # Add user: username/password
    root@<guest-VM>:~$ adduser <username>

.. _spice_sunstone:

Configure VM for SPICE
----------------------

SPICE connections are channeled only through the noVNC proxy. SPICE support in Sunstone share
a similar architecture to the VNC implementation. Sunstone use a **SPICE-HTML5** widget in
its console dialog that communicates with the proxy by using websockets.

.. note:: For the correct functioning of the SPICE Web Client, we recommend defining by default
    the SPICE parameters in ``/etc/one/vmm_mad/vmm_exec_kvm.conf``. In this way, once the file is modified and OpenNebula is restarted, it will be applied to all  the VMs instantiated from now on. You can also override these SPICE parameters in VM Template. For more info check :ref:`Driver Defaults
    <kvmg_default_attributes>` section.

.. _virt_viewer_sunstone:

Configure VM for virt-viewer
----------------------------

``virt-viewer`` connections are channeled only through the noVNC proxy. virt-viewer is a minimal tool
for displaying the graphical console of a virtual machine. It can **display VNC or SPICE protocol**,
and uses libvirt to look up the graphical connection details.

In this case, Sunstone allows you to download the **virt-viewer configuration file** for the VNC and
SPICE protocols. The only requirement is the ``virt-viewer`` being installed on the machine from which you are accessing the Sunstone.

To use this option, you will only have to enable any of two protocols in the VM. Once the VM is
``instantiated`` and ``running``, users will be able to download the ``virt-viewer`` file.

|sunstone_virt_viewer_button|

.. _vmrc_sunstone:

Configure VM for VMRC
---------------------

.. important::

    VMRC connections are available only when a reachable FireEdge server is found.

*VMware Remote Console* provides console access and client device connection to VMs on a remote host.

These types of connections request a ``TOKEN`` from vCenter to connect with the Virtual Machine
allocated on vCenter every time you click on the VMRC button.

To use this option, you will only have to enable VNC / VMRC connections to your VMs and start the
FireEdge Server.
