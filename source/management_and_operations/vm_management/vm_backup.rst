Managing Virtual Machines Backup
================================================================================


Requirements
================================================================================

To be able to store the VMs backups you need to run your own MarketPlace ideally it should be not coallocated with your datastores. You can configure two types:

* :ref:`HTTP MarketPlace<market_http>`.
* :ref:`S3 MarketPlace<market_s3>`.

Backup Configuration
================================================================================

Each VM which you might need to backup needs a separate configuration within the VM template defining the configuration attributes below:

+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
|                  Attribute              |                                     Description                                          |
+=========================================+==========================================================================================+
| ``FREQUENCY_SECONDS``                   | Hard limit for the minimum time in seconds between two backups.                          |
+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``MARKETPLACE_ID``                      | ID of the MarketPlace where the backups will be stored.                                  |
+-----------------------------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------+

For example, the following section force a minimum time of 24 hours between backups for the VM and specify that the backups will be store in Marketplace 100:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ onevm show 423
    ...
    BACKUP = [
        FREQUENCY_SECONDS = "86400",
        MARKETPLACE_ID    = "100"
    ]


Generating Backups
================================================================================

In order to generate a backup the ``onevm backup`` must be executed. Periodically backups can be generated by executing the command periodically with well known tools like `cron`.

.. important:: Note that ``FREQUENCY_SECONDS`` will set a hard limit on the minimum time between two backups for a VM. If ``onevm backup`` command is executed before ``FREQUENCY_SECONDS`` seconds have passed since the last backup it will exits successfully without generating a new backup.

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ onevm backup <vmid>

    onevm backup 423 -v

    $ onevm backup <vmid> # No new backup is created as FREQUENCY_SECONDS is set to 24 hours
    $

.. warning:: Running VMs will be powered off, backed up and resumed.


Automatic Backup all VMs
================================================================================

To backup all your VMs you may use a script located at `/usr/share/one/backup_vms`. Simply, add to the ``oneadmin`` cron something like:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

   */30 * * * * /usr/share/one/backup_vms

.. important:: Make sure that the ``FREQUENCY_SECONDS`` attribute is properly aligned with the periodicity defined in the cron configuration.

When a backup is finished the ``BACKUP`` section of each VM is extended with extra attributes ``LAST_BACKUP_TIME`` containing the backup timestamp and ``MARKETPLACE_APP_IDS`` which refers to the created marketplace appliances.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    BACKUP=[
        FREQUENCY_SECONDS = "86400",
        LAST_BACKUP_TIME="1614013088",
        MARKETPLACE_APP_IDS="778,779",
        MARKETPLACE_ID="100"
    ]

Also, those attributes are shown on the Sunstone VM info tab.

Restore a Backup
================================================================================

To restore a backup you simply run `onevm restore` and if the VM have correct BACKUP data in the template it will be restored and started.

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    onevm restore <vmid> -d <dsid>
    onevm restore 423 -d 1
    2021-02-22 18:28:30 INFO  : Reading backup information
    2021-02-22 18:28:30 INFO  : Restoring VM 423 from saved appliance 779
    2021-02-22 18:28:30 INFO  : Backup restored, VM template: [353], images: [482]
    2021-02-22 18:28:30 INFO  : Instantiating the template [353]

.. |image1| image:: /images/backups.png

Managing Old Backups
================================================================================

The VM metadata only store the reference to the **latest** backup. Each time a new backup is generated this metadata is updated to point to the new backup. Be aware that the ``onevm restore`` command will use this information to automatically restore the latest backup.

.. important:: If older backups need to be restore, the procedure will need to be done manually.

Older backups are not deleted from the MarketPlace, in order to avoid running out of storage we suggest to implement a housekeeping strategy to periodically remove old backups from the MarketPlace.
