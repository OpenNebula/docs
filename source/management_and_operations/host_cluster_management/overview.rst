Overview
==========================

A **Host** is a server that has the ability to run Virtual Machines and that is connected to OpenNebula's Front-end server. To learn how to prepare the Hosts, you can read the :ref:`Open Cluster Deployment <open_cluster_deployment>` guide. Hosts are usually grouped in **Clusters**.

How Should I Read This Chapter
================================================================================

In this chapter there are four guides describing these objects.

* **Host Management**: Host management is achieved through the ``onehost`` CLI command or through the Sunstone GUI. You can read about Host Management in more detail in the :ref:`Managing Hosts <hosts_guide>` guide.
* **Cluster Management**: Hosts can be grouped in clusters. These clusters are managed with the ``onecluster`` CLI command or through the Sunstone GUI. You can read about Cluster Management in more detail in the :ref:`Managing Clusters <cluster_guide>` guide.

You should read all the guides in this chapter to familiarize yourself with these objects. For small and homogeneous clouds you may not need to create new clusters.

Hypervisor Compatibility
================================================================================

These guides are compatible with all hypervisors.
