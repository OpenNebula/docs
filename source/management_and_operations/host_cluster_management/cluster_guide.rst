Clusters
================================================================================

Clusters group together Hosts, datastores and virtual networks that are configured to work together. A cluster is used to:

  * Ensure that VMs use resources that are compatible.
  * Assign resources to user groups by creating Virtual Private Clouds.

Clusters should contain homogeneous resources. Note that some operations like live migrations are restricted to Hosts in the same cluster.

The requirements for live migrating VMs between hosts of the same cluster are that no differences occur in the following areas of the hypervisors:

* CPU model
* Firmware settings
* Microcode version
* BIOS version
* BIOS settings
* Libvirt version
* QEMU version
* Kernel version

Cluster Management
================================================================================

Clusters are managed with the ``onecluster`` command. To create new clusters, use ``onecluster create <name>``. Existing clusters can be inspected with the ``onecluster list`` and ``show`` commands.

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ onecluster list
      ID NAME            HOSTS NETS  DATASTORES

    $ onecluster create production
    ID: 100

    $ onecluster list
      ID NAME            HOSTS NETS  DATASTORES
     100 production      0     0     0

    $ onecluster show production
    CLUSTER 100 INFORMATION
    ID             : 100
    NAME           : production

Add Hosts to a Cluster
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every Host must belong to a cluster, so if no cluster is specified it will be assigned to the ``default`` cluster by default. Hosts can be created directly in a different cluster by using the ``--cluster`` option of ``onehost create``, or be added at any time with the command ``onecluster addhost``. Hosts can be in **only one cluster** at a time.

To delete a Host from a cluster, the command ``onecluster delhost`` must be used.

In the following example, we will add Host 0 to the cluster we created before. You will notice that the ``onecluster show`` command will list the Host ID 0 as part of the cluster.

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ onehost list
      ID NAME         CLUSTER     RVM   TCPU   FCPU   ACPU   TMEM   FMEM   AMEM STAT
       0 host01       -             7    400    290    400   3.7G   2.2G   3.7G   on

    $ onecluster addhost production host01

    $ onehost list
      ID NAME         CLUSTER     RVM   TCPU   FCPU   ACPU   TMEM   FMEM   AMEM STAT
       0 host01       producti      7    400    290    400   3.7G   2.2G   3.7G   on

    $ onecluster show production
    CLUSTER 100 INFORMATION
    ID             : 100
    NAME           : production

Add Resources to Clusters
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Datastores and virtual networks can be added to multiple clusters. This means that any Host in those clusters is properly configured to run VMs using images from those datastores, or is using leases from those virtual networks.

For instance, if you have several Hosts configured to use a given Open vSwitch network, you would group them in the same cluster. The :ref:`Scheduler <schg>` will know that VMs using these resources can be deployed in any of the Hosts of the cluster.

These operations can be done with the ``onecluster`` ``addvnet/delvnet`` and ``adddatastore/deldatastore``, respectively:

.. prompt:: bash $ auto

    $ onecluster addvnet production priv-ovswitch

    $ onecluster adddatastore production iscsi

    $ onecluster list
      ID NAME            HOSTS NETS  DATASTORES
     100 production      1     1     1

    $ onecluster show 100
    CLUSTER 100 INFORMATION
    ID             : 100
    NAME           : production

The System Datastore for a Cluster
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In order to create a complete environment where the scheduler can deploy VMs, your clusters need to have at least one System Datastore.

You can add the default System Datastore (ID: 0), or create a new one to improve its performance (e.g. balance VM I/O between different servers) or to use different System Datastore types (e.g. ``shared`` and ``local``).

To use a specific System Datastore with your cluster, instead of the default one, just create it and associate it just like any other datastore (``onecluster adddatastore``).

Managing Clusters in Sunstone
=============================

The :ref:`Sunstone UI interface <fireedge_sunstone>` offers an easy way to manage clusters and the resources within them. You will find the cluster sub-menu under the infrastructure menu. From there, you will be able to:

-  Create new clusters selecting the resources you want to include in this cluster.

|create_cluster|

-  See the list of current clusters, from which you can update the existing ones, or delete them.

|dashboard_cluster|

-  See cluster details and update overcommitment.
