Self-signed SSL certificate
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For the non-production or development purposes, you can generate your own dedicated SSL certificate following way:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ mkdir mycerts
    $ cd mycerts
    $ openssl req -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout key.pem -out certificate.pem -days 365 -batch

Get the content of files:

- ``key.pem`` for contextualization param ``ONEAPP_SSL_PRIVKEY``
- ``certificate.pem`` for param ``ONEAPP_SSL_CERT``

.. important::

    The self-signed certificates are impractical for a production environment! For the serious use, you should get SSL certificates from the trusted certificate authority or use the `Let's Encrypt <https://letsencrypt.org>`_.
