Create SSH Key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you don't have any SSH key pair, you can create it by running:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ ssh-keygen -f ~/.ssh/one

Find the private key in ``~/.ssh/one`` and the matching public key in ``~/.ssh/one.pub``. Print the generated SSH public key by:

.. prompt:: text $ auto

    $ cat ~/.ssh/one.pub

Copy and paste the whole content of the public key into the proper form area in the OpenNebula (SSH public key).

.. important::

    Handle your SSH keys with care! Anyone who can access your SSH private key can also log into your virtual machines!
