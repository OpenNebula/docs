The VR in OpenNebula is a solution to common problems regarding management of VNETs and routing, including:

* Keepalive Failover, High-Availability for the `Service Virtual Router` itself.
* Router4, to fine control routing between your virtual networks.
* NAT4, so you can enable your private virtual networks to reach the Internet.
* HAProxy Load Balancer, a robust layer4 (TCP) reverse-proxy/load-balancing solution.
* Keepalive LVS Load Balancer, so called layer4 switching, a high-performance load-balancing solution.
* SDNAT4, a public to private, private to public IP address mapping (SNAT + DNAT).
* DNS, a DNS recursor (to provide DNS to isolated virtual networks).
* DHCP4, a DHCP server implementation (if the usual contextualization doesn't work for you).

The full documentation of the `VR appliance <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki>`_ is maintained in the OpenNebula Apps project.
