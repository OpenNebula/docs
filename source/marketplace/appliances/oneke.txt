OneKE is a minimal `hyperconverged <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyper-converged_infrastructure>`_ Kubernetes platform that comes with OpenNebula out of the box. OneKE is based on `RKE2 - Rancher's Next Generation Kubernetes Distribution <https://docs.rke2.io/>`_ with preinstalled components to handle:

* storage persistence,
* ingress traffic,
* load balancing.

The full documentation of the `OneKE appliance <https://github.com/OpenNebula/one-apps/wiki>`_ is maintained in the OpenNebula Apps project.
