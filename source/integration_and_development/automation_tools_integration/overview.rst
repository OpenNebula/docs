   * :ref:`Ansible <ansible>`: to manage common OpenNebula resources, e.g. VMs, images or hosts, using Ansible playbooks
   * :ref:`Terraform <terraform>`: to create and manage OpenNebula clusters resources (e.g VMs, images, services, ...) using the OpenNebula Terraform Provider
   * :ref:`Docker Machine <docker_machine>` for the automated creation of ready Dockerized hosts within OpenNebula Clouds
   * :ref:`Rancher <rancher_integration>` to create and manage Kubernetes clusters on OpenNebula Clouds
