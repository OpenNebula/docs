OpenNebula includes a number of extensions and plug-ins that allows the integration of OpenNebula with other open source software. In this guide we review the integration of OpenNebula with following third party tools:

   * :ref:`Ansible <ansible>`: to manage common OpenNebula resources, e.g. VMs, images or hosts, using Ansible playbooks
   * :ref:`Terraform <terraform>`: to create and manage OpenNebula clusters resources (e.g VMs, images, services, ...) using the OpenNebula Terraform Provider
